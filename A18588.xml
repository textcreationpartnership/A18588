            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be not onely cauills of profane men, but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits in the hearts of the godly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them much, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the neceſsitie and benefit of vſing praier. For firſt, if God know what we want before we aske, what neede is there, or what auaileth it, to ſhew and ſolicite our ſuits to him which knoweth them alreadie? for ſuch rehearſalls are woont to be troubleſome and grieuous. S. Hierome anſwereth very finely: That, <hi>in prayer we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11241:4"/>are no ſhewers, but ſuiters:</hi> and it is one thing, to make knowne to him that is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; and another thing, to intreat and aske of him that knoweth. Yet this anſwer remooueth not all difficultie. For our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father doth not onely know, what thing we want, but alſo vnasked of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care and fauour, is readie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his owne accord to helpe vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we aske. And therefore it ſeemeth, there is either no benefit or no neede of praying; I anſwer: we doe not pray with that intent, and for that ende, as though we would by our praiers ſtirre vp God, and put him in minde of his dutie, beeing negligent and careles of our affaires; or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe as beeing hard and merciles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure him by our praiers, and bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an other minde. We know indeede that God is readie of his owne accord to giue good things, but yet to thoſe which doe repent, and humble themſelues vnder the mightie hand of God, who by faith do ſeeke, knocke, and aske. And therefore we doe poure out our praiers before God,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11241:4"/>not for that we doubt of his good will, but that we may indeede ſhew our ſelues to bring true repentance, becauſe he hath promiſed ſorgiueneſſe of ſinnes to them which repent, Ezek. 8.23. that he will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage his iudgements, and beſtow his bleſsings, Ier. 18.8. and giue grace vnto the humble, 1. Pet. 5.5. And that it may appeare that when we call vpon God, and thinke vpon his promiſes, we bring with vs and likewiſe doe exerciſe true faith, becauſe the Lord hath promiſed all good things to him that doth knocke and aske, Math. 7.7. and that we doe come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may receiue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and find grace to helpe in time of need, Hebr. 4.16. Againe, ſpirituall bleſsings can not otherwiſe be receiued then by faith: indeede bodely or outward benefits are oft beſtowed vpon the wicked alſo: and yet that thoſe may be profitable vnto vs, it is the will of God that we ſhould wait for them by hope, and receiue them by faith from his fatherly hand. And therefore we pray in faith, that we may ſhew forth our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11241:5"/>deſire to receiue from God not onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſsings, but thoſe eſpecially which are ſpirituall, heauenly, and eternall. And that we would ſo receiue from God the bleſsings of this life, that by his bleſsing they may be profitable vnto vs. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God would haue this glorie giuen to himſelfe, to be the fountaine, the author and giuer of euery good thing, Iam. 1.17. &amp; that we ſhould wholly relie vpon him: we therfore in praier doe teſtifie, that we neither aſcribe them to any other, nor ſeek them elſwhere, but doe wholly hope for, expect, and require the ſame from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: for God hath promiſed, that he will be readie and willing to helpe ſuch. Alſo in our praiers we doe thus lay open our wants and miſeries before God, not as though we knewe them not, but that by pouring out our cares in the Lords bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, we may disburden &amp; eaſe our owne ſoule. And the promiſe is moſt ſweete and comfortable, Pſal. 37.5. and 55.22. 1. Pet. 5.7. Roule &amp; caſt thy waies vpon the Lord, and he will haue care and bring it to paſſe.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11241:5"/>
               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> addeth alſo this reaſon why we ſhould pray: That <hi>by often calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God we may become familiar with him.</hi> Again, that we may more highly eſteem, and more reuerently vſe that which God beſtoweth vpon vs when we aske and knocke.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are carefully to be thought vpon concerning the neceſsitie and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of praier, leaſt that beeing otherwaies too cold and backward vnto praier by theſe conceits, that God is forward to help vs of his owne accord, we doe ſuffer our ſelues to be withdrawne from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of praier. Neither let vs abuſe that moſt ſweete ſentence of the readie good-will of God toward vs, which ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be an incitation and a motiue to excite and confirme our diligence &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in praier. There be ſome which reaſon thus, or at leaſt doe trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with thoſe conceits: ſeeing God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asked, and before we pray doth know, yea beforehand hath ſet down &amp; appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what he will doe and what he will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11241:6"/>giue: we doe therefore either aske in vain, that which otherwaies ſhould come to paſſe; or els doe wickedly in praying, as though we hoped by our praier to turne God from his firme decree and purpoſe, and ſo make him changeable and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. To this obiection ſome anſwer thus. If that which we aske be ordained before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to be done, then we pray vpon good and ſure confidence. If it be not, yet we goe not about to hinder or ſtoppe the courſe of Gods predeſtination; becauſe we pray that Gods will may be done. But <hi>Luthers</hi> expoſition is more plaine &amp; ſafe; to wit, that we are not commaunded to buſie our ſelues about the hidden fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God, or to ſearch into his ſecret counſels: but we muſt diſpoſe our ſelues according to his will reuealed vnto vs in his word, where he teacheth that by repentance and praier, gods wrath is appeaſed, many dangers and euills are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, and many benefits obtained. Ier. 18. v. 8. Ezek. 33. v. 11.1. King. 8. v. 56. And therefore he hath ſtraitly charged vs to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11241:6"/>pray: yea he is angry when no man ſets himſelfe by praier betweene the Lord and the land leſt it be deſtroied, Ezek. 22. v. 30. Both theſe therefore do warne vs to pray, firſt that god of his owne accord is readie to helpe, and knoweth what we want, &amp; what himſelfe will doe. Secondly, that it is his will and commaundement we ſhould pray. Neither muſt we from the ſecret foreknowledge of god, frame or admitte exceptions againſt thoſe things which are plainely revealed and commaunded in the word. If thou canſt not reconcile them, leaue vnto god the hidden reaſons of his ſecret foreknowledge, and doe thou thoſe things which are commaunded and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to thee in the reuealed word; to witte, that thou maiſt pray and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. Theſe things I haue noted by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that ſaying: <hi>Your heauenly father knoweth whereof yee haue need, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye aske,</hi> Math. 6. v. 8.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt before this prayer giues this commaundement: <hi>After this manner pray ye:</hi> whereby he would not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11241:7"/>bind thoſe whome he teacheth to pray, vnto this ſet number of wordes as vnto a worke done: for that were to babble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede. And the Apoſtles themſelues, as we may read in their acts, and epiſtles, often prayed in other wordes after the deliuerie and receiuing of this forme of prayer from our Sauiour Chriſt. And that which is the ſtrongeſt proofe, Mathew and Luke ſetting downe this Lords prayer, doe not cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iouſly obſerue the ſelfe ſame wordes altogether. But our Sauiour Chriſt in a ſhort example would ſhew vnto his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the manner howe to pray, according as his cuſtome was to teach a generall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by propounding ſome particular example, where vnder the ſpeciall we are to vnderſtand the generall. And therefore in this platforme of prayer, his purpoſe is to ſhewe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> howe few and ſmall a number of wordes we muſt vſe in prayer, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the vaine babbling of the Phariſes &amp; of the Heathen.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> VVho is to be called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to whome we muſt direct our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> with what confidence we muſt pray:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11241:7"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> howe and for what cauſes:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> what thinges we are to aske: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> in what order: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> by what meane: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> and for what end. And thus are all the principall points, which are required in true prayer, contained in this platforme. So that it was both truely and finely ſaide of <hi>Auſtine</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Proba,</hi> we haue libertie in praying to vſe other wordes ſo that we ſay the ſame things which this prayer containeth: but we haue not liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſay other, diuers or contrarie things. And this it is which Mathew ſaith, cap. 6. v. 9. <hi>thus, or after this manner pray ye.</hi> And that ſaying of Chriſt recorded by S. Luke 11. v. 2. <hi>when ye pray, ſay</hi> is all one with this. But here Auſtine mooues this obiection: if we muſt not vſe many wordes in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for that our heauenly father knows our want by the ſame reaſon, and for the ſame cauſe, we ſhould not vſe fewe wordes, no not thoſe which are here appointed by our Sauiour Chriſt. The anſwere is: that in regard of God, and for his cauſe, we neede, neither many nor few, nor any wordes at all in prayer, neither doth the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11241:8"/>forme of prayer conſiſt in the repetition of wordes. For to pray is to lift vp the minde vnto god,
<note place="margin">What it is to pray.</note> to poure out the heart before God, &amp; to aske ſomething of him: but no man doth truely aske any thing, which deſireth not the ſame, and deſire is an affection of the minde. And therefore though he vtter with his mouth the beſt wordes that can be, vnles there be alſo a lifting vp of the minde, with attention and deuotion, ſo as the heart may truely deſire that which he asketh, that man prayeth not indeed. But he that lifteth vp his mind, and with a deuoute inward affection of heart, doth intirely aske any thing of God, that man doth truly pray, although he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe not in wordes his deſire. One man cannot intreat another vnles he vſe words or geſture: but the inward and moſt ſecret corners of the mind and heart are plainely ſeene of God, and therfore Dauid ſaith, <hi>my growning is not hid from thee,</hi> Pſal. 38. v. 10. &amp; Pſal. 10. v. 17. <hi>The Lord heareth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the poore: thine eare harkeneth to the preparation of their heart.</hi> And Pſal.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11241:8"/>38.10. <hi>My whole deſire is before thee.</hi> Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. v. 26. When we knowe not what to aske, the ſpirit it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs, with ſighes which cannot be expreſſed. And it were a fooliſh thing, therefore to vtter our praier in wordes, as though god could not vnderſtand the deſire of our heart. And yet the Saints of god in the old teſtament, and the Apoſtles in the new are ſaid, to haue vſed wordes in praying. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Chriſt without cauſe ſay thus, in Luke, <hi>[when ye pray, ſay]</hi> but it was for our ſakes and for our prayers. Which is carefully to be conſidered, that we may learne to vſe vocal prayer wel and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: for our minde doth not throughly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and regard thoſe things which we want, or are to aske, eſpecially if they be ſpirituall, and pertaine to the glory of god. And therefore the words which we vſe in praying, doe by a kind of advertiſement lead vs to that conſideration, that ſo the deſire of our heart may be rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Now the heart in praier ought to be penitent and humble. But becauſe we doe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11241:9"/>for the moſt part ruſh vpon this exerciſe of praier, without due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of our ſinnes and vnworthines: therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing of words is profitable, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to if the minde giue heede, that we may pray with the Spirit and with the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo, 1. Cor. 1.15. then will the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation thereof prepare the heart to ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repentance and to true humilitie. The deſires of our heart are commonly out of order, ſo as oftentimes men neither think vpon the order, nor on the ende of thoſe things they are to require: but the words which we vſe in praier doe aduertiſe vs of thoſe things we are to thinke vpon when we pray. And doubtles the rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and meditation of Gods promiſes doth ſtirre vp, kindle, and increaſe our faith. We are often ſlow to praier, and in praying cold and drowſie, neither doe we come vnto God with the deuotion of minde we ought to doe. But when as in praying we repeat the words, by diligent meditation thereon, and by due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſe and commandement,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11241:9"/>our minde is mooued to lift vp it ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, our deuotion is kindled, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once kindled is conunued and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Alſo the diligent marking of thoſe things we are to aske, whereof we are put in minde by the words of our praier, doth excite and kindle in our benummed and frozen heart a good affection vnto praier. For thoſe wordes, becauſe they are the words of Chriſt, be the toole or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spirit, whereby the Spirit of praier will be powerfull and effectuall in vs. And therefore that which Chriſt here deliuereth <hi>[When we pray, SAY:]</hi> doth binde vs ſo farreforth as the rehearſall of words in praying is hereunto auaileable, to excite, and kindle, to continue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our deuotion, leaſt it ſhould waxe colde and benummed and be quenched altogether. And hereunto ſometime lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger praiers ſerue beſt, otherwiſe thoſe which are ſhorter. To this purpoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin in his 121. epiſtle to Proba, writeth many things ſubſtantially, ſome whereof pertaining to this place, I will here ſet
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11241:10"/>downe. <hi>He which forbiddeth much bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in praier, becauſe he knoweth what is needefull for vs, doth likewiſe command that we ſhould alwaies pray and not faint: not becauſe he would haue our will made knowne to him, whereof he cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but to exerciſe our deſire, whereby we may receiue that which we are about to giue. For that which he would giue is very great, but we are little and ſtrait and can not receiue the ſame. And therefore it is ſaide vnto vs, open thy mouth: for ſo much the more fully ſhall we receiue that which is exceeding great, by how much we doe more faithfully beleeue it, more firmely hope for it, and more earneſtly deſire it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therfore we doe alwaies praie in faith, hope, and charitie, with a continued de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: but yet at certaine times we doe with words intreat the Lord, that ſo we may admoniſh our ſelues, how much we haue profited in this deſire, and likewiſe excite our ſelues to doe the ſame more cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. That therefore which the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>[pray continually,]</hi> is nothing els but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11241:10"/>this, continually deſire a bleſſed life. And therefore at certaine houres we doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our minde from other cares and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, whereby this deſire is cooled in ſome ſort vnto this exerciſe of praier, and by the words of the praier, doe admoniſh our ſelues to giue heede to that which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; leaſt that which hath begunne to be warme, doe waxe cold altogether, and at length be wholly put out, vnles it be more often kindled. And therefore to continue in praier ſome long time, is not (as ſome thinke) to vſe much babbling: for much ſpeach is one thing, and long continued affection is another thing. It is ſaide of the Lord himſelfe that he continued whole nights in praier, and vſed to pray very lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. The brethren in Egypt are ſaide to pray very often, but yet very briefly, and in a manner to diſpatch them quickly, leaſt that earneſtnes which was carefully begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould by longer delay waxe dull and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away. And by this alſo they doe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare, that this earneſtnes as it is not to be forced, when it will not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11241:11"/>ſo it is not ſpeedily to be broken off, if it will longer endure. For in praier we muſt not vſe many wordes, and yet we muſt not want much deſire, if ſo be our zeale will perſeuere. To pray much, is to knocke vnto him whome we pray vnto with a continuall and a godly lifting vp of the heart: and for the moſt part this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe is better performed in ſighes and grones, then with wordes: and by wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping then by ſpeaking. For our groning is not hid from him, who by his word made all things, and deſireth not the wordes of man. But therefore muſt we vſe words in praier, that we may be put in minde to haue regard to that we aske, not that we may thinke thereby to teach or mooue the Lord. Theſe things doth Auſtin teach. And for this ende doth S. Paul appoint the publike rehearſall of praier and pſalmes in the Church, Coloſſ. 3.6. <hi>Teach and ad. moniſh your own ſelues in pſalmes, hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs, ſinging with grace in your hearts vnto the Lord, that the words of Chriſt may dwell in you plenteouſly.</hi> 1. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11241:11"/>14.26. <hi>When ye come together hath any one a pſalme? let him pray vvith the Spirit and with the vnderſtanding, that all things may be done to edification.</hi> And becauſe it is ſometime needefull that we ſhould vſe words in praier,
<note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Lords prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> there can be no praier more profitable then that which the Lord himſelfe deliuered and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For firſt of all,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> it doth briefly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende all thoſe things which can be well and fittely asked of the Lord, ſhewing of whome we muſt aske them, in what manner and order, and for what ende and purpoſe. And Saint Auſtin ſaith, If you ſhall peruſe the wordes of the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all the Saints of God, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the whole ſcripture and cheifly in the Pſalmes, you ſhall finde nothing which is not briefly contained and concluded in this Lords praier. Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> as the Creede containes the rule of faith, ſo this Lords prayer is the rule of all prayers. For he that deſires any thing in prayer (ſaith Auſtine) or ſpeaketh any thing which cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this Evangelicall prayer, his prayer
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11241:12"/>is not ſpirituall but carnall and vnlawefull.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, for authority: for the ſonne of god himſelfe, who is our advocate, that bringeth our praiers vnto the father, who obteyneth for vs the ſpirit of praier, who together with the father heareth vs he preſcribed vnto vs this forme of prayer. It is a friendly and familier praier (ſaith Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian) to intreat the father by the words of the ſonne. The father will acknowledge the wordes of the ſonne when we make our prayer: and then we haue Chriſt our advocate with the father for our ſinnes. Let vs propound the wordes of our aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, when we miſerable ſinners intreat for our ſinnes. Theſe thinges ſaith Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
<note place="margin">How the Lords prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt be vſed.</note> And it were not onely raſhnes but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, to diſdaine either the ſhortneſſe or ſimplicity of the Lords prayer, as though thou thy ſelfe couldſt finde out and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a better forme of praying. And yet the rehearſing of the Lords prayer muſt be no vaine mumbling ouer, as though the wordes vttered without vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had ſome magicall force; but we muſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11241:12"/>conſider what the wordes do ſignifie, and put vs in minde of, how farre they reach, and how many things they conteyne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, that we may pray with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and with the vnderſtanding, 1. Cor. 14. v. 15. and may include our wants in thoſe petitions. For by this meanes (as it hath bin ſaid) thoſe words will ſtirre vp our deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let vs therefore briefly conſider eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, &amp; compare the deſcription of S. Mathew, with that which is ſet downe by Luke, cap. 11. v. 2. &amp;c. For although accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to S. Luke, Chriſt repeated that form of prayer at another time and vpon other occaſion, then Matthew recordeth: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the forme therof is the ſame in both places, the comparing of them together in this expoſition will not be vnprofitable.</p>
            <p>And here we muſt obſerue, that ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin books omitting ſome things do repeat this form of praier more briefly in S. Luke, then it is deſcribed by Mathew. For in the beginning it is only ſaid <hi>[Father:]</hi> and this which followeth in S. Matthew <hi>[which art in heauen]</hi> is omitted. The third petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11241:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>alſo is omitted. <hi>[thy wil be do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e in earth as it is in heauen.]</hi> This alſo is omitted. <hi>[But deliuer vs from euill.]</hi> And Auſtine ſaith expreſſely in his Enchiridion, cap. 115. &amp; 116. that the lords praier in Mathew containeth ſeauen petitions: but in S. Luke, it hath not ſeauen but fiue petitions onely. And he ſheweth that that petition, <hi>[thy wil be done]</hi> is contained in the two former: &amp; this <hi>[but deliuer vs:]</hi> in that which went before it, <hi>[Lead vs not into temptation.]</hi> Whence I gather that the Latin bookes euen in Auſtins time, had the Lords prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er according to Luke as it is now read. But the Greeke bookes doe ſet downe that whole prayer, euen ſo with Luke, as it is in Mathew; ſaue onely that with Luke doth wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>[for thine is the kingdome.]</hi> Now it might ſeeme that ſuch things as were wanting with Luke in this place, haue beene added from the Greeke bookes out of Mathew. But Auſtine in his booke <hi>of the words of the Lord,</hi> vpon Luke cap. 28. And Ambroſe in his fift booke of the Sacraments cap. 4. doe ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:11241:13"/>that whole praier out of Luke as it is extant in Mathew. Whence I gather, that the latin bookes differed at that time, and ſome of them read it ſo in Luke in this place, as it is in the greeke, others read it ſo as it is now in the vulgar latin tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which is in ſome words, that we wil note in the expoſition. And that very diuerſity of ſome wordes doth ſhew, that we are not bound to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious rehearſall of wordes in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>This praier containes three parts: the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance or preface, petitions, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, of each whereof I will ſpeake in order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Our father which art in heauen.]</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine ſaith, whereas in euery earneſt ſute, we ought to procure his good will to whome we make our requeſt, and that is moſt conueniently done by the praiſe and commendation of his benefites to whome we praie, therefore ſeeing we neither can nor ought to boaſt of our owne merits before God, Chriſt in the beginning of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11241:14"/>this praier hath commanded vs to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>[Our father.]</hi> Hugo ſaith, that Chriſt like a good oratour before the petitions prefixeth a ſhort preface, wherin fauour is ſought for from the perſon as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, when we ſay <hi>[Father:]</hi> from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon asking, when we ſay <hi>[Our.]</hi> And ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe aduertiſments haue their vſe. But becauſe it hath beene declared before, that we are to vſe words in praier, not ſo much to mooue the minde of God, by rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inſinuations, as by rehearſing and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on the wordes to ſtirre vp in our ſelues, attention, deuotion, confidence, and care to frame our praiers aright, that we may ſhew our ſelues to be ſuch ſuiters as the Lord would haue: therefore thoſe words are principally to be imploied for this ende and purpoſe. We will briefly note out in ſeuerall points, thoſe things which are principally to be thought vpon by occaſion of theſe words.</p>
            <p>As firſt, theſe words <hi>[Our father]</hi> doe giue vs to vnderſtand, that praier ought not to be ſuch a bare deſire in a wiſhing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11241:14"/>manner, as men are woont to ſay: <hi>would God this good might happen vnto me: oh that this danger or this euill might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued: God bleſſe it and prosper it: God forbid,</hi> and ſuch like: but we muſt expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name him, of whome we deſire to haue our requeſt graunted vnto vs. And not in generall tearmes onely, as when we ſay, <hi>God graunt: God forbid:</hi> but we muſt by name ſpeake vnto and call vpon him, that our praier may be directed vnto him <hi>[our father]</hi> as it were in communication. And whereas the pſalmes doe ſpeake in the third perſon: <hi>God be mercifull vnto vs: God bleſſe vs:</hi> we muſt vnderſtand that praier, to be directed either to the mediatour, that for his ſake God would be mercifull vnto vs and bleſſe vs; or elſe the deuotion of the mind is to be referred to the ſecond perſon. For it is the Scripture phraſe to ſpeake vnto a perſon preſent in the third perſon, as Gen. 33.14. <hi>Let my lord goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſeruant.</hi> 1. King. 16.16. <hi>Let my lord the King command.</hi> and chap. 25.25. <hi>Let not my lord the King I pray thee, ſet his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11241:15"/>heart againſt Nabal.</hi> And in that vſuall phraſe of Scripture, <hi>let the king liue,</hi> is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode: <hi>I pray God the King may liue.</hi> And therefore in what words ſoeuer the prayer be framed, the minde muſt alwaies thinke vpon God, and behold him, that our deſires and requeſts may be directed vnto him. For this is the forme and rule of our prayer, to ſay <hi>[our Father.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, theſe wordes doe admoniſh vs, that prayer or invocation is not to bee directed to any creature, but onely to the heauenly father: ſo as we may not direct our prayer to them, of whome we are ſure their ſpirits doe liue with God. For the name <hi>Father</hi> is alſo oppoſed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Iſay. 63. v. 16. <hi>Doubtles thou art our Father though Abraham be ignorant of vs, &amp; Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell know vs nos: thou Lord, art our Father and our redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, thoſe wordes doe teach vs, that we muſt ſo conceiue of God, and ſpeake to god in prayer, as he hath revealed his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence vnto vs in his word. For the heathen when they goe to pray, they thinke of a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:11241:15"/>God that is eternall, the Creatour, almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but who that God is they knowe not. But we are taught by theſe wordes, to make a difference betweene our calling vpon God, and the praiers of the heathen: and to thinke that we call vpon that God who hath thus made knowne his beeing vnto vs in his word, that he is the Father, the ſonne, and the holy Ghoſt: to witte, the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſpirit of his ſonne into the hearts of the faithfull, whereby we crie, <hi>Abba fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> For ſo the word <hi>[Father]</hi> is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood eſſentiallie in this place, for <hi>God,</hi> or for the <hi>Diuine Maieſty,</hi> or for the whole Trinity, which is the <hi>Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as it is written, Deut. 32. v. 6. <hi>Is not he thy father that hath bought thee, which hath made thee and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned thee.</hi> Iſaie, 63. v. 16. <hi>Thou Lord art our father, and our redeemer, or he that diſchargeth vs from bondage.</hi> The Sonne alſo is called by this generall title, <hi>Father of Eternity,</hi> Iſay, 9.6. And the holy ghoſt is called the <hi>Father</hi> of the poore.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:11241:16"/>
            <p>This title therefore doth admoniſh vs when we are about to pray, to ſettle our minde againſt all levity, inconſideration &amp; pride, in ſuch deuotion, reuerence and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, as thoſe which remember them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to poure out the wordes of their prayer, not vnto the aire, or before any creatures, but before the diuine Maieſtie, whom we come vnto in our praier, Eph. 3. v. 14. <hi>before whoſe face we doe appeare,</hi> Pſal. 141.2. and Pſal. 119.58. beſeeching him to be neere and preſent in all our ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the word <hi>Father</hi> alſo, may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be vnderſtood perſonally, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for the perſon of the father, the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and moouing whereof doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily include the Sonne whereto it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And by the ſpirit of the Sonne we crie <hi>Abba Father.</hi> So that the ſeuerall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Trinitie in their offices and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits toward the Church, are offered to our conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the preface of this prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And thus Saint Paul did vnderſtand the name <hi>Father</hi> in prayer indiuerſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11241:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſpecially Eph. 3.14. <hi>For this cauſe doe I bend my knees vnto the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth <hi>[Our father]</hi> when he ſaith, Ioh. 20.17. <hi>I aſcende vnto my father and your father: to my God, and to your God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this title comprizeth not onely that the father from eternitie hath begotten his onely begotten Sonne but in reſpect of the Father, it containeth the benefits of our regeneration, adoption, and calling to an heauenly inheritance. In reſpect of the Sonne the mediatour, it containeth the merit, office, and the benefits of his propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, reconciliation, &amp; interceſsion, that it may warne vs of that which the Sonne promiſeth. Ioh. 16.23. <hi>Whatſoeuer ye ſhall aske the father in my name, he will giue it you.</hi> And becauſe a doubting and diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full praier obtaineth nothing, Iam. 1.6. but as it is written, Mark. 11.24. <hi>I ſay vnto you, what ſoeuer ye ſhall deſire when ye pray, if you ſhall not vvauer in heart, but beleeue that ye ſhall receiue it, they ſhall be done vnto you.</hi> So that this title <hi>[Our father]</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11241:17"/>vs with what faith and confidence we are to pray vnto God: to wit, not in proud and Phariſaicall preſumption, for our owne iuſtice or worthineſſe, for the works and merits either of our ſelues or others, but with an humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confeſsion of our owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, for the merit and interceſsion of the onely Sonne of God our Mediatour, for whome the father hath adopted vs to be ſonnes and heires, Eph. 1.5. As Daniel ſaith in his praier: <hi>We haue ſinned and done wickedly: we doe not preſent our ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before thee in our owne righteouſnes, but in thy great tender mercies: heare vs for the Lords ſake.</hi> Likewiſe, that whereto this title <hi>[fasher]</hi> hath relation doth put vs in minde of moſt ſweete conſolation. Heb. 2.17. <hi>That in things concerning God vve haue a mercifull and a faithfull high prieſt.</hi> And 1. Ioh. 2.1. <hi>If we ſinne, we haue an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the father, who is the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſinnes.</hi> Hebr. 7.25. and 9.24. <hi>Euer liuing and appearing in the ſight of God for vs, to make interceſsion for vs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11241:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>which by him doe come vnto God. For he hath receiued gifts for men,</hi> Pſal. 68.19. <hi>and he beſtoweth the ſame on vs,</hi> Eph. 4.11. So by theſe words, that we are not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to call God a Lord, iuſt, great, almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, terrible, but our Father, is ſtirred vp in thoſe which pray, confidence that they ſhall be heard and obtaine their requeſts. Hebr. 4.16. <hi>Let vs therefore goe boldly to the throne of grace, that we may receiue mercie and finde grace to helpe in time of neede.</hi> And moſt ſweete is the ſaying of Bernard: <hi>That praier which taſteth ſweet of a fatherly name, giueth me aſſurance that I ſhall obtaine all my requeſts.</hi> For the title Father affoardeth vs this confidence, as Chriſt himſelfe declareth, Ioh. 16.23. that our praiers are not either grieuous or vngratefull vnto God, but the father ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs that he is delighted with this our dutie, if we come vnto him by our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and his fatherly minde is carefull for our neceſsities, Matth. 6. v. 32. And of his owne accord is readie and forward to heare and to helpe vs, Luk. 11.9. and pſal.

            </p>
            <p>Againe, this title teacheth them that pray, to conſider and trie themſelues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be indeede the ſonnes of God, members and brethren of Chriſt, ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed of the father. For they that goe on in their ſinnes without repentance, and doe not ſeeke &amp; imbrace Chriſt by true faith, that by him they may be reconciled vnto God, cannot call God father. So very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things doth this title teach vs.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, whereas we doe not onely ſay [<hi>Father,</hi> but <hi>our father,</hi>] this bringeth vs to the conſideration of that which Chriſt ſaith, Ioh. 20.17. <hi>I aſcend vnto my father and your father:</hi> to witte, that we ſhould conceiue and thînke, that God who is by nature the father of Chriſt, is for his ſake by grace, out father alſo, not by nature but by adoption. And leaſt we ſhould thinke, that he were onely the father of ſome few, which be indued with great vertues and excellent gifts: therefore when we ſay <hi>[our father]</hi> we doe include the whole bodie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:11241:18"/>of beleeuers, wherein all the members are not alike. The conſideration whereof ſerues to beat downe pride, and to worke humilitie in the children of God that haue attained to greater meaſure of grace, that they may not chalenge any thing peculiar to themſelues in this fatherhood, but rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon themſelues among the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon flocke of Gods children, ſaying <hi>[Our father.]</hi> It ſerueth alſo to put courage into the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſort, that they may not thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be excluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that fatherhood, but make account that God is no leſſe their father, then the father of Marie, Iohn Baptiſt, and Paul: and therefore are they commanded to ſay <hi>[Our father.] For we pray vnto a father that iudgeth vvithout reſpect of perſons,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.17.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this very title doth put vs in mind of brotherly loue: for if there be one which is our father, Math. 23.9. then are we bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and members one to another, Mala. 2.10. <hi>Haue we not all one father, and one God? why then doth euery one despiſe his brother?</hi> This alſo teacheth vs to pray not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:11241:19"/>onely for our owne wants, but alſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mend vnto God in our praier the neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our whole brotherhoode, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery member thereof ſaying, <hi>[Our father: giue vs: forgiue vs.]</hi> Neither neede we to doubt if ſo be we be members of that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but that the common praiers of the whole bodie doe alſo include our neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For therefore eſpecially hath he fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a forme of praier, for ſuch an harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or conſent, as himſelfe ſpeaketh; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth principally require our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be common, that a few might meete together in his name, and agree among themſelues what they will aske, Math. 18.20. And yet becauſe we are commanded to pray in ſecret priuately in our chamber: therefore when we ſay <hi>[Our father,]</hi> it is requiſite that euery one doth applie vnto himſelfe, that common promiſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhoode: as Thomas ſaid well, <hi>My God and my Lord:</hi> and as Paul ſaith, <hi>I thanke my God:</hi> and ſo doth euery ones faith by this applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well conclude, &amp; ſay, <hi>God is my father,</hi> as Ier. 3.4. <hi>Therefore from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11241:19"/>at leaſt crie vnto me, thou art my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> and after v. 19. <hi>I did take thee for my children, and ſaide, Thou ſhalt call me, my father.</hi> and Math. 6.6. <hi>Pray vnto [thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther] which is in ſecret, and [thy father] will reward thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So very many profitable inſtructions are propounded vnto vs in theſe fewe words of this preface to the Lords praier: which may thus alſo be conſidered, that by the remembrance of thoſe benefits which God hath heretofore beſtowed vpon vs, God may as it were be mooued to giue, and our confidence ſtirred vp and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to craue other moe neceſſaries: that ſeeing of meere fauour he hath beſtowed vpon vs the chiefeſt benefite of adoption, becauſe he will be our father and alſo be ſo called, therefore he will giue vs other things needefull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which art in heauen.]</hi> There be ſome that by occaſion of this verbe ſubſtantiue <hi>[es, art,]</hi> doe diſcourſe at large about the immutable eſſence, and thoſe names of God, <hi>I am that I am: which is, which was,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:11241:20"/>&amp; which is to come.</hi> But the Greek words doe neither require nor admit that diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this place: for the wordes are plaine, [<hi>Our father</hi> ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς, <hi>which art in heauen</hi>] to ſhew, that we doe not call vpon any earthly father, but on him who is, or who doth dwell in heauen, that is, an heauenly father. For ſo Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe expoundeth theſe wordes, Math. 6.26. when he nameth an
<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And whereas Heauen in Scripture is called the throne, the ſeate, manſion, or dwelling place of God, and in this place we call vpon our father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; the meaning is not, that the infinite eſſence of God is circumſcribed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, either in theſe viſible heauens, or in the heauen called <hi>Empyreum,</hi> that is, the higheſt heauens, ſo as he is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent elſe where: for it is written 1. King. 8. v. 27. and 2. Chro. 2. v. 6. that heauen, and the heauen of heauens can not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him. For he filleth heauen and earth, Ierem. 23. v. 23. yea he is preſent in heauen in earth, in the ſea, and in hell, Pſal. 139. v. 7.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11241:20"/>he is higher then heauen, deeper then hell, longer then the earth, broader then the ſea. That is, he is wholly preſent euery where, within all things and without all things, as Gregory ſaith. Neither doe we thinke, when we call vpon our father which is in heauen in the preface of this prayer, that he is ſeperated and diſioyned, from vs which pray, from our wants, and from our prayers being further abſent, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen is diſtant from the earth. Like as the thoughts and the ſayings of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are deſcribed, Iob. 22. v. 13. what ſhould God ſee? he walketh in the circle of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and conſidereth not our affaires. For in the 145. Pſalme v. 18. it is written. <hi>The Lord is readie at hand to them that pray, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to them that call vpon him in trueth.</hi> Deut. 4. v. 29. <hi>The Lord our God is neere to all our requeſts.</hi> and Mathew 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered togither in my name, and ſhall aske any thing, there am I in the middle among them.</hi> Nowe whereas our father of whome we make no doubt, but that he is preſent to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11241:21"/>is ſaid to be in heauen, this the ſchoole men expound after this ſort; either that the workes of God doe more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and highly appeare in the beutie, magnificence, harmony and workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the viſible or materiall heauens, then in earth: or els becauſe in thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall heauens (as they call them) he doth by a full communication of himſelfe, declare, exhibite, and ſhew forth, all his glorie, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, goodneſſe, magnificence, not as here on earth by certain meanes and couerings inviſible, and by ſundry lettes, but in full ſhewe and fruition of ſight face to face, to be ſeene and enioyed of the bleſſed Angels and of elect ſoules: ſo as the very thing, is the happines, the ioy, ſaluation &amp; the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life of the ſaints.</p>
            <p>But I ſee not what comfort this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning can affoard vnto vs, which pray here on earth vnder the croſſe, and in much weakeneſſe. A more plaine expoſition is this. Becauſe the ſcriptures doe define of heauen wherein God hath his abode, not by any locall ſcituation; but by heauenly &amp;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11241:21"/>diuine glory, maieſtie, power, and fidelitie. Againe, that therefore God is ſaid to be in heauen, and to dwell in the heauens, in the place of his abode, to heare in the dwelling place of his abode. 3. King. v. 30. becauſe all things are vnder his gouernment, he hath all things in his hand and in his power, he ruleth all things in all places, he is able to doe, and he doth whatſoeuer he will, by his wiſdome he foreſeeth, knoweth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth, and heareth all things, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way how to helpe them all, by his prouidence he careth for all, and by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer doth order, diſpoſe, adminiſter and gouerne all things &amp;c. Pſal. 115. v. 3. <hi>Our God is in heauen. he doth whatſoeuer be will.</hi> Pſal. 103. v. 20. <hi>God hath prepared his ſeate in heauen, and his kingdome ruleth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all in all places of his dominion.</hi> 3. King. 8. v. 39. <hi>thou ſhalt heare in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thou ſhalt be fauour able, and ſhalt forgiue ſinnes. For thou onely ſeeſt and knoweſt the hearts of all the children of men.</hi> Pſal. 113. v. 5. <hi>which hath his dwelling on high, that he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold things below, in heauen, and in earth.</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:11241:22"/>Pſal. 102. v. 20. <hi>The Lord hath looked down from his high ſanctuarie: out of heauen did he behold the earth: that he might heare the mournings of the priſoner, and looſe the children of death.</hi> Pſal. 11.4. <hi>The lords ſeat is in heauen, his eyes looke vnto the poore, and his eye lids trie the children of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Pſal. 20. v. 6. <hi>he will he are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen by the mightie helpe of his right hand.</hi> Iſa. 63.15. <hi>Give heede from heauen and behold: where is nowe thy zeale, thy ſtrength, and the multitude of thy mercies.</hi> And when the Lord ſheweth his diuine glory, power and mercy by any famous hearing, helpe, and deliuerance, the ſcripture ſaith, then God hath exalted or aduanced himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the heauens, and magnified his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy vp to the heauens, Pſal. 57. v. 6. and 18. v. 5. and 113. v. 4. <hi>his glorie is aboue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.</hi> Pſal. 68. v. 19. <hi>He hath aſcended aboue the heauen of heauens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe teſtimonies of ſcripture doe plainely expound that phraſe, where God is ſaid to be, or to dwell in heauen. The conſideration hereof will alſo further
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11241:22"/>vs to expound the doctrine of Chriſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention or exaltation into heauen, of his ſitting at the right hand of God in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places. And thus the meaning of this preface of the Lords prayer is euident: for when we ſay <hi>[Our father,]</hi> we doe by ſaith conceiue the readie willing minde, and the forwardneſſe of God toward vs. And when we adde, <hi>[which art in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:]</hi> I We adde to the good will of God, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power, that he is able to doe and to giue thoſe things we aske, hauing al things in his power. II. Diuine prouidence, that ſeeth and knoweth our wants, that he is preſent to our requeſts and heareth the ſame: that he hath a care of vs: that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, diſpoſeth, adminiſtreth, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth all things, and more eſpecially in his Church. III. Diuine wiſdome, that he knowes the way to ſend helpe and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. IV. Diuine rule and dominion, to wit, that it belongeth to his kingdome &amp; office, who dwelleth in heauen, to heare our prayers, to regard our affaires, to help, to deliuer, &amp;c. In a word: the Lords praier
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:11241:23"/>ſaith, that our father whome we call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, or doth dwell in heauen. I. Leſt we ſhould conceiue in our minde any baſe or earthly thing of God, after the manner &amp; faſhion of this world, but all things heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diuine. II. To ſhewe a compariſon and a difference betweene our earthly, and our heauenly father: as Chriſt expreſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them one to the other, Math. 23. v. 9. <hi>Call no man your father vpon earth: for there is one your father, which is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> III. That by this title we may be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to aske of God heauenly things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially: and to referre thoſe earthly things which we aske, vnto the heauenly. For we are called and borne a new to an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance which is laid vp in heauen, as it is written. 1. Pet. 1. v. 3. IV. That by this title we may be taught to acknowledge our life in this world to be a pilgrimage from God, and that our deſire to this true hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly countrey may be ſtirred vp in vs, &amp; withall that we may declare that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we aske is for this ende, to bring vs to the countrey, where our father is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:11241:23"/>As for that Allegorie of Auſtine and others, that God is in heauen, that is, by grace he dwelleth in the Saints, and thoſe which pray ought to wiſh for themſelues that God may dwell in them, as it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede impious, ſo in this place it is forraine and vnfit: for it belongeth to the ſecond petition, that Gods kingdome may come vnto vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hallowed be thy name:]</hi>
               <note place="margin">II. part.</note> Nowe followe certaine petitions in this prayer. For it is not a true praier when we doe only heap vp the glorious titles of God: but praier ought to aske ſome thing of God, or elſe giue him thankes for benefites receiued, Philip. 4.6. and 1. Timoth. 2.1. And vſually here are numbred ſeauen petitions, which are as it were generall ſeales and markes, whereto we may and ought to referre, and wherein we muſt include all thoſe things that we aske. For it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 1. Ioh. 5.14. <hi>This is that aſſurance we haue with God, that if we aske any thing according to his vvill he heareth vs.</hi> and Iam. 4. v. 3. <hi>Ye aske and receiue not, becauſe ye
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:11241:24"/>aske amiſſe, that ye may ſpende it on your pleaſures.</hi> And therefore out of the petitions of this Lords praier which is the rule of praying, we may gather, what things we are to aske in praier, in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and for what end we muſt aske them. For they are thus deuided, that the former regard the glory of God eſpecially, ſo farre forth as our ſaluation is ioyned therewith. The reſt containe our wants, our profit &amp; ſaluation, whereof ſome belong to the body, others to the ſoule: ſome to this worldly life, ſome to our ſpirituall life in this world, and others to our heauenly life to come. Againe, ſome petitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the giuing and beſtowing of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, either temporall, or bodily, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, or heauenly which are to come: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe craue the remoueall of euils ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporall or ſpirituall, that thoſe which are paſt, may be forgiuen &amp; not imputed, thoſe which are preſent may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way or leſſoned, and thoſe which are to come may be kept backe. Againe in the Lords prayer we both craue the ende, to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11241:24"/>witte, the glorie of God and our owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and thoſe things which tend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. The Lords praier alſo ſheweth the order of thoſe things we are to aske. For firſt thoſe things are to be asked which concerne the glorie of God &amp; our owne ſaluation: then ſuch things as belong to the neceſsitie, benefite, and commoditie of our bodie and of this life, may well be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and ought ſo to be. So likewiſe in the turning backe of euills, ſuch as hinder the glorie of God, or our ſaluation muſt haue the firſt place. And then we may pray that the aduerſities, tribulations, difficulties and troubles of bodie and of this life, may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taken away or leſſened. But tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or bodely benefits muſt be asked with that condition or moderation, If it be the will of God; If they will further the glorie of God and our ſaluation: but if God ſhall know and iudge thoſe things to be hurtfull vnto vs, which we thinke to be good and profitable vnto vs when we aske them, that he would keepe them backe and hinder them as euill. Alſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11241:25"/>bleſsings muſt be asked for that end, that they may be ordered, directed, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Gods glorie, and to ſpirituall, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and eternall bleſsings. And thus from the petitions of the Lords praier, may wel be gathered, what things we may and ought to aske, and in what manner accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God. Likewiſe S. Paul in certaine diſtinct words doth ſhew and declare the kindes of things that are to be asked in praier, Philip. 4.6. and 1. Timoth. 2.1.

            <p>Now that we may the ſooner diſpatch
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11241:25"/>the expoſition of the ſeuerall petitions, I will here declare vnto what general heads of meditations the meaning of euery pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is to be referred as we pray; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as I was wont to vſe them publikely in expounding the Catechiſme, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate exerciſes of religion. To wit, that firſt of all we doe conſider by godly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout meditation, what bleſsings we pray for in euery petition, either to be giuen vs; or if they be giuen, to be preſerued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. Secondly, what euills in euery petition we deſire to be ſtopped, that they may not happen, if they be to come: or beeing preſent, to be turned backe, that we may be freed and deliuered from them: and if the remooueall be begunne, that the ſame may ſtill goe forwarde more and more. Thirdly, what bleſsings are to be acknowledged in euery petition, that we may be thankfull for the ſame: and that this confeſsion and thankſgiuing may be kindled, may grow and be increaſed in vs. Fourthly, in euery petition there muſt be humble confeſsion, that thoſe things
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11241:26"/>which are propounded, are not asked of vs continually, nor earneſtly and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently, but ſeldome and coldly: and that we doe not ſufficiently conſider of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof: and that contrarie to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, we our ſelues indeed doe refuſe and ſhake off thoſe bleſsings which we craue, and the euills which in word we pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, by the very contrarie acte we fetch and drawe vnto our ſelues: that we doe not acknowledge benefits receiued, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are heartily thankfull for them, but forget the ſame: that we regard them not, neither vſe them reuerently with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to the glorie of God, but vngrateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through abuſe doe beſtow them ill.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are to be acknowledged and bewailed with humble confeſsion in euery petition and withal we muſt thinke vpon, and by praier ſeeke for reformation. And all thoſe things are to be applied, both in generall to the whole bodie of the Church, and priuately vnto our ſelues, and namely alſo vnto thoſe whoſe neceſsitie is knowne vnto vs. Thus ſhall we haue large
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11241:26"/>meditation in euery petition, which we will not handle in this place, becauſe it is not my purpoſe at this time; but wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ſame to euery mans priuate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.</p>
            <p>Onely we will expound the wordes in euery petit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Hallowed be thy name,]</hi> That we may finde out the true meaning of this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt expound the words. There is no doubt but here is treated the praiſe, honour, &amp; renowme of God. For <hi>[Name]</hi> is oft taken for glorie and renowme, Gen. 6.4. they are called men of Name, whoſe fame was renowmed. Deutr. 26.19. <hi>The moſt high will ſet thee above all nations which he hath made, in praiſe,</hi> in Name, <hi>and in glorie.</hi> The word <hi>[Hallowed]</hi> as we ſhall ſhew by and by, is often vſed when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing is highly and gloriouſly renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as famous. But that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſider the meaning of this petition
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11241:27"/>in a godly meditation, we will for plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſake deuide the expoſition into ſome parts. I. And firſt in generall this petition being put in the firſt place, doth commend vnto vs the deſire of Gods glorie, that we ſhould chiefly and before all things care for, and ſeeke the glorie of God. And that we ſhould referre al things which we aske and doe, to Gods glorie as to the true end, 1. Cor. 10. v. 31. <hi>Doe all to the glorie of God.</hi> And becauſe in this corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are not much carefull for the true glorie of God, thoſe things which we doe, which we aske, which we receiue, we doe either not at all, or in truth not earneſtly referre them to the glorie of God, but in ſtead of glorie, we put contempt and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vpon God, we profane, we pollute, and blaſpheme his name: therefore we are commanded to praie, that God from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen would kindle, preſerue, and increaſe in vs, a true deſire of Gods glorie; and that we may be kept, defended, and deliuered from all forgetfulnes, contempt, propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, defiling, and blaſpheming the name
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:11241:27"/>of God and of his glorie.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, the name of God doth ſignifie whatſoeuer proprieties of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, attributes or vertues, God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed and declared in his word concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eſſence, his will, and his workes: as that he is <hi>wiſe, iuſt, great, terrible, good, gentle, mercifull, patient, penitent, ielous, viſiting iniquitie,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>The Ievves becauſe they will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the name <hi>Iehovah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thargum Hieroſolymi. tanum.</note> in ſtead thereof vſe <hi>Shem.</hi> Thence the Caldie paraphraſe for God himſelfe, putteth <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhem,</hi> a name, Gen. 10.9. for the vertues or perfections of God, are the very eſſence of God. Now that name of God cannot be hallowed by any addition, infuſion, acceſſe, or increaſe of holines: as it is written of vs, <hi>He that is holy, let him be more holy,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. 22.11. for it is holy in it ſelfe, that is, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and exempt from, excelling and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding all other common and prophane things in puritie and holines.</p>
            <p>But as the word <hi>[hallowed]</hi> is vſed, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. 10. v. 3. for when the Lord had ſlaine
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11241:28"/>the two ſonnes of Aaron which offered ſtraunge fire, he ſaith, <hi>I vvill be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe vvhich come neare me.</hi> and Ezek. 38. v. 23. For the vengeance taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gog and Magog he ſaith, <hi>I will be mag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nified and ſanctiſied.</hi> I ſaie, 5. v. 16. After the threatning of puniſhments, he ſaith: <hi>The Lord of hoaſts ſhall be exalted in iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and the holy God ſhall be</hi> hallowed <hi>in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> Ezek. 20. v. 9. Speaking of the returne of his people, he ſaith, <hi>I will be</hi> ſanctified <hi>of you in the ſight of the heathen.</hi> and chap. 28. v. 22. of the puniſhment of Sidon, and the deliuerance of Iſrael he ſaith, <hi>I will be</hi> ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified <hi>in them.</hi> Chap. 36.23. Concerning the returne of his people he ſaith: <hi>Not for you, but for myne owne holy name will I doe this thing, I will</hi> ſanctifie <hi>mine owne great name, that the heathen may knowe that I am the Lora. when I ſhall be ſanctified in you before them.</hi> And in this ſenſe doe we pray, that God would exhibite, ſhew forth and declare the glory and excellency of his name, that is, of his perfections, of his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes or vertues, whereof we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11241:28"/>by ſome notable worke in his Church, or againſt his enimies, like as it may be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly expounded and vnderſtood of euery name of god, which thing I leaue and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the priuate diligence of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. So likewiſe, conſidering that <hi>[Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther]</hi> went before, and nowe followeth <hi>[Hallowed be thy name,]</hi> we may well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by <hi>Name,</hi> the benefits of the perſon, the office of the Father, the merits and benefits of the ſonne the Mediatour: and the office and bleſsings of the holy ghoſt, which are revealed &amp; made known in the ſcripture. Thoſe we deſire to be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that is, mercifully to be declared, made knowne, and ſhewed forth towards vs. So the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>we muſt beleeue in the name of the onely begotten; that we receiue remisſion of ſinnes, and eternall life in the name and by the name of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe things be ſeuerally vnfoulded, they will affoard very large meditation:
<note place="margin">ὑπομνή<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ματα.</note> but we onely lay downe the cheife heads of things for memories ſake.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:11241:29"/>
            <p n="3">III. By relation alſo we deſire that the name of god may be hallowed among vs, with vs, and of vs, that is, that thoſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which we ſaid were comprehended vnder the name of god, might ſhine forth with vs, become knowne in vs, be ſpread abroad, and become renowned in all the world. According as the ſcripture ſaith. <hi>I will be</hi> ſanctified <hi>before the nations, that they may know that I am the lord.</hi> And the contrary, whereby we are forbidden to pollute, to profane, or blaſpheme the name of god, ſheweth moſt plainely, what it is to hallow or ſanctify it. We pray therefore that god would giue vs grace, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to conſider, reuerently to ſet forth &amp; aduance thoſe vertues and workes of god, in thought word and deed. As it is vvritten Pſal. 48.11. <hi>According to thy name ſo is thy praiſe.</hi> Which alſo may and ought to be enlarged in this expoſition and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnto all the eſſentiall and perſonall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of god. Againe, we do heare deſire, that we may with holineſſe and reuerence thinke, and ſpeake of the workes and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11241:29"/>of god, that we be not euil or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuters, ſo as we ſhould wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or prophanely iudge of his prouidence and chaſtiſements towards vs, and of his long ſuffering towards our enimies, by complaining and murmuring againſt the ſame; or elſe abuſe his goodneſſe, his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe and patience. Numb. 20. v. 12. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Moſes and Aaron doubted of obtaining water, and the people murmured, the lord ſaith: <hi>ye haue not beleeued me, that ye might</hi> ſanctifie <hi>me before the children of Iſraell.</hi> 1. Pet. 3.5. <hi>Be not afraide in time of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quution, but</hi> ſanctifie the Lord <hi>in your hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. Seing the name of god concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eſſence, his will, his workes, and iudgements is made knowne to vs in the word, we doe pray that the name of god, that is, his word, may be giuen and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto vs, purely, ſincerely, in true and ſound vnderſtanding, holily, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corruption or deprauation: that ſincere and faithfull miniſters may be giuen vs for the edification of the Church, which may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:11241:30"/>diſcharge their duty faithfully, and be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with neceſſarie gifts; And that we may be mercifully kept and preſerued from all corrupting and deprauing of the word of god, from woolues and hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Anſwerable to this, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the giuing of the word, for the holy and ſingular bleſsing of god, we muſt reuerently receiue it, with diligence and deuotion heare, thinke and meditate on the ſame. We muſt alſo ſanctifie and adorne the ſame with a godly life, leſt by vs the name and doctrine of god be polluted and euil ſpoken of. 1. Tim. 6. v. 1. <hi>And that other by our godly conuerſation, may be drawne to loue and embrace this doctrine.</hi> Math. 5. v. 16. <hi>that they may ſee our good workes and glorifie your father.</hi> Rom. 2. v. 23. <hi>By breaking the lawe thou diſhonoureſt God, and for you is the name of god blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe let all theſe parts be applyed to the foure general heades before ſet down. To wit, I. What bleſsings we deſire to be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11241:30"/>giuen vs, to be preſerued and increaſed. II. From what euills we deſire to be kept &amp; deliuered. III. What benefits we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be beſtowed on vs, and what thanks we ought to render againe for the ſame. IV. What manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fefsion of ſinns we muſt make from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And let theſe be applyed in ſpeciall vnto the whole Church, and in particular vnto our ſelues and vnto thoſe whoſe want we know. So will the meditation of this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be very large.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let thy kingdome come to:]</hi> In greeke it is ſimple [come;] but becauſe in Luke, 11. v. 20. it is written, <hi>The kingdome of God is come vnto you:</hi> It is not amiſſe tranſlated <hi>[adueniat, Let come too.]</hi> Moreouer the kingdome of god is taken diuers waies. For there is a generall or vniuerſall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, whereby he doth mightily gouerne all creatures, Pſal. 103. v. 19. his <hi>kingdome ruleth ouer all.</hi> and Pſal. 145.13. <hi>Thy kingdome is an euerlaſting kingdome.</hi> But this we doe not properly vnderſtand, for that doth mightely runne ouer all, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11241:31"/>can hinder it, neither any creature withdraw it ſelfe from vnder it; vnles we vnderſtand our prayer thus; that all men may acknowledge, obſerue and reuerence the prouidence of that kingdome of God whereby he ruleth, gouerneth and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all things, and that they may humbly ſubiect themſelues vnto it in all things. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, there is the kingdome of grace in the Church in this life, and the kingdome of glory in the life to come, which is heere properly to be vnderſtood as the preface it ſelfe ſheweth. For we ſay, Our father, <hi>[thy kingdome]</hi> come. And this is called the kingdome of the father, the kingdome of Chriſt, and the kingdome of heauen; &amp; the more to commend the free gift of God, we ſay not; that we come to the kingdome of God, but doe pray that it may come to vs; or as Chriſt more plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaketh, Luke, 11.20. <hi>that the kingdome of God may come before hand vnto vs.</hi> And this is called the kingdome of the father, the kingdome of Chriſt, &amp; the kingdome of heauen. Nowe the kingdome of grace
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:11241:31"/>is not meat and drinke, but righteouſneſſe, peace, and ioy, in the holy Ghoſt, Rom. 14. v. 17. It conſiſteth not in ſpeach but in trueth and in power. 1. Cor. 2. v. 5. We pray therefore that the holy ghoſt may be giuen vs, that he may be powerfull in vs by the word, to illuminate, to conuert, iuſtifie, ſanctify, to lead, guide, confirme, &amp; preſerue vs, that we may be found in that kingdome, and there abide and perſeuere, leſt we ſhould fall away thence againe, and ſlide backe into the kingdome of Satan. That God would oppoſe his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome againſt the kingdome of Satan and of the world, that he would keepe backe and bind the deuil, that he would ſuppres, beare downe, and breake of the treaſons, and the power of the deuil and the world, and mercifully defend &amp; keepe his church from the ſame: that is, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, Pſal 110.2. <hi>that he would rule by the power of his right hand in the middeſt of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: that he would tread down Satan vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our feete.</hi> Rom. 16. v. 20. <hi>keepe vs from the world,</hi> Ioh. 17. v. 15. <hi>that we may ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:11241:32"/>the world,</hi> 1. Ioh. 5.4. and Ioh. 16.33. <hi>that he would deliuer vs from the preſent euill world,</hi> Gal. 1.4. <hi>leaſt we ſhould loue and deſire the kingdome of the world, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and neglecting the kingdome of God: leaſt ſinne ſhould raigne in our mort all bodies,</hi> Rom. 6.12. <hi>and iniquitie beare rule ouer vs,</hi> Pſal. 9.13. and 119. <hi>but that ſinne may be crucified and mortified in vs,</hi> Galat. 5.24. that we may become ſubiect to the direction of the Holy ghoſt, and be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of him into the obedience of god, and become ſeruants vnto righteouſneſſe. That we anſwer not thus: <hi>We wil not haue this man to raigne ouer vs.</hi> Luk. 9.14. <hi>that we caſt not off his yoke from vs.</hi> Pſal. 2.3. but take it vnto vs: becauſe his yoke is ſweete and eaſie, that we may finde reſt vnto our ſoules, that trauailing and beeing heauie laden we may flie to the throne of his kingdome, and there haue refreſhing. Math. 11.29. Hebr. 4.16. <hi>that we may first ſeeke the kingdome of God.</hi> Math. 6.33. that we may ſit downe in the kingdome of heauen and not be caſt thence. Math. 8.11.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11241:32"/>that we be not offences in the kingdome of God, Math. 18.6. that the kingdome of God be not taken from vs, Mat. 21.43. that the kingdome of God may be within vs, Luke, 17.21. That Chriſt may remember vs in his kingdome, Luke, 23.42. And that this kingdome may continually be ſpread further abroad, may alſo come to other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and countryes, and more men euer nowe and then, may be gathered to that kingdome. And to be ſhort, that we may earneſtly ſay: Bleſſed be the kingdome promiſed to Dauid, which commeth in the name of the Lord, Marke, 11.10. &amp; that we may receiue that kingdome, Luke, 19.15. be made and remaine citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhould of God, Ephe. 2.19. And concerning the kingdome of glory we pray, that God would make vs meete to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light. Coloſ. 1.12. that we may inherit and poſſeſſe that kingdome by the grace of adoption. Math. 25.34. 1. Cor. 15.50. that we may be mercifully kept and preſerued from all things which may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11241:33"/>vs from the entrance and poſſeſsion thereof. And that, 2. Tim. 4.18. we may loue, waite for and deſire the comming of the kingdome of glory, and make haſte therevnto, 2. Pet. 3.12. That we may be counted worthy the kingdome of God, 2. Theſ. 1.5. who hath called vs into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and glory, 1. Theſ. 2.13. that an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance may be made vnto vs, into the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdome of God. 2. Pet. 1.11. and that we may be ready at the comming of that kingdome, Luk, 12.40.</p>
            <p>Theſe things we muſt aske in generall, for the whole body of the Church, and priuately euery one for himſelfe, for thoſe whome we knowe, both friends and eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Likewiſe we muſt apply the ſame to thoſe foure chiefe heades before ſet down. To wit, what good things we are to pray for in this petition: what euills we are to pray againſt: for what benefits we are to giue thankes: and what ſinnes of ours we muſt humbly acknowledge and confeſſe in this petition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thy will be done:]</hi> The will of God is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11241:33"/>diuers waies: and therefore from the diſtinction of gods will, we ſhall moſt eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to the meaning of this petition. Auncient writers call one will of god, the will of his good pleaſure, diſpoſition, or decree, when as god himſelfe willeth and appointeth to do any thing. Now our wil is weake euen in it owne ſtrength, and is often hindred by ſome other thing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we had need to pray, that god would miniſter ſtrength to that good thing that we purpoſe in our owne heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue all impediments, ſo that we may performe the ſame in action; But we neede not to pray for that, concerning this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing will of god, becauſe he is almightie, neither can it be well and in a godly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner prayed for. For god doth whatſoeuer he will in heauen and in earth. Pſal. 115.3. Who hath withſtood his will? Rom. 9.19. The will of god abideth for euer. Iſaie, 14.27. <hi>The Lord hath decreed it, who can diſanull it? his hand is ſtretched out, who can turne it away?</hi> Iſay, 4.6.11. <hi>My counſell ſhall ſtand, and my whole will ſhall be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:11241:34"/>
            <p>There is another <hi>reuealed</hi> or <hi>ſignified</hi> will called <hi>[volunt as ſigni.]</hi> Wherby god commaunding or forbidding any thing in the law or in the Goſpell, ſheweth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth what he will haue vs to doe, and to leaue vndone, Rom. 12.2. This is called the good will of god, his well pleaſing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will. So that in this petition we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confeſſe that by our own ſtrength we cannot doe and fulfill the will of god, propounded vnto vs either in the lawe or in the goſpell.</p>
            <p>We pray therefore that god would giue vs the ſpirit of regeneration and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, which may create in vs a newe heart, take away our ſtony heart, ſubdue and aboliſh our carnall ſtubberneſſe and impatience, that we may thinke vpon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, wil, and doe, ſuch things as pleaſe god, that we may auoide and omitte the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, leſt we ſhould doe any thing that is contrary to the will of god. And if we find our ſelues not to regard, not to approoue, not to will, not to doe thoſe things which god willeth, but ſuch as god forbiddeth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11241:34"/>and abhorreth; we pray that thoſe things may be amended in vs by his holy ſpirit in true repentance, that our will may be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from euill, and made conformable to that which is good.</p>
            <p>On the contrarie, there is another will of the deuill, of the world, and of the fleſh, altogither vnlike and reſiſting the will of God. Thoſe therefore we renounce and reiect in this petition; praying, that the will of the world, and of the deuill may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſubdued, and the ſuggeſtions of Satan may be broken of, that we may not obey them, nor conforme our ſelues like vnto the world, and that the luſts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence of the fleſh in vs, may be crucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and mortified by the ſpirit, that hauing the diſobedience, the impatience, and the wicked luſt of the fleſh ſuppreſſed in vs, our will may become ſo conformable to the will of God, that we ſhall deſire, couer, or do nothing, but which that is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and approued of god. That we may iudge reverently of the will of God, and ſubmitte our ſelues thereto, and that the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11241:35"/>will of God may be done in vs. Which good will of god the ſcripture containeth in theſe three points. <hi>I will that a ſinner may be converted.</hi> Ezek. 33.11. <hi>It is the will of God that we ſhould beleeue in the ſonne of God,</hi> Ioh. 6.39. <hi>This is the will of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen your ſanctification, that we ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from ſinne.</hi> 1. Theſ. 4.3. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe we aske of god, grace, ſtrength, and aide, that we may beginne and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the ſame.</p>
            <p>An other will of God they call his <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue and permitting will.</hi> For whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is done in all the worlde and in the Church, whatſoeuer befalleth vs, ſure it is, it commeth not to paſſe without the will of god, Math. 10.29. either working or permitting the ſame. And becauſe we doe either not approove this will of god in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, or els complaine thereof through impatience, murmuring and ſtriuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame: therefore we pray for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that we may with reuerence and obedience, ſubmit, or at leaſt indeauour to ſubmit our will to the will of god, &amp; may
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11241:35"/>ſtriue againſt impatience, not iudging ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly of thoſe things which happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by the will and permiſsion of god, but ſaying, <hi>as it pleaſeth the lord, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to paſſe.</hi> And becauſe we cannot doe this of our owne ſtrength, therefore we pray eſpecially that god would giue vs patience, ſubiection and obedience: and ſtrength and courage againſt impatience. Thoſe things alſo which we aske, though they ſeeme very conuenient, meete and profitable for vs, yet we muſt alwaies ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte them to the will of god, <hi>Not my will but thine is fulfilled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others alſo make an <hi>optatiue will of god,</hi> wherein he ſheweth by the very fact, that he wiſheth and deſireth thoſe things which are profitable and holeſome for vs; which notwithſtanding we our ſelues do often hinder by the contrary act. As when it is ſaid: <hi>God would haue all men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to come to the knowledge of the trueth. How often would I haue gathered thee, and thou wouldeſt not? I will not the death of a ſinner: but rather that he may
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11241:36"/>conuert and liue God would haue none to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh but all men to come to repentance.</hi> Where we pray, that this wil of god may be mercifully fulfilled in vs, and not remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from vs by the ſuggeſtions of Satan, by the allurements of the world, and the concupiſcence of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In earth, as it is in heauen:]</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſme in this place is more fully expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thus: euen as it is in heauen, ſo alſo in earth. Chryſoſtome thinketh, that this clauſe is to be referred, as it were in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, vnto the former petitions. <hi>Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be thy name: thy kingdome come, in earth as it is in heauen.</hi> Nowe here we haue very good occaſion to conſider of that which Paul ſaith, that <hi>in Chriſt are reconciled and ſet at one, things in heauen and things in earth,</hi> and <hi>that there ſhal be one companie of bleſſed angels and of men:</hi> and <hi>we,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>ſhall become like vnto the angels.</hi> We are therefore taught to pray, that this conformitie betweene the companie of angels and of men, may be begunne in this life, that we may make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11241:36"/>and ſigh after that bleſſed communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And becauſe the Angels doe readily and chearefully, without all ſtubburnneſſe and reſiſtance, of meere loue and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, execute thoſe things which they know God willeth: as it is ſaide, pſal. 103.20. <hi>The angels excell in ſtrength, that doe his commaundement in obeying the voyce of his word,</hi> to doe his will: therefore we doe pray, that this alſo may be begunne in vs. Againe we are admoniſhed, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring we doe belong to this communion, that we ſhould conforme our ſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and not vnto this world, becauſe we are not of this world, but belong vnto an heauenly citie. Now this conformitie or likenes is begunne in this life: but it ſhall at length be perfect in the life to come, which is eternall.</p>
            <p>Further, as the Angels thinke reuerently of the iudgements of God, and in all things approoue of that which God willeth: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo we deſire, that by the grace of god and the worke of his ſpirit, we may doe the ſame here vpon earth. And ſo this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:11241:37"/>clauſe containes a very profitable admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that while we liue in the fleſh here on earth, we ſhould beginne to lift vp our head and our ſoule, to deſire and to thinke vpon our conuerſation in heauen with the bleſſed angels, and labour to beginne our conformitie therewith here on earth.</p>
            <p>Here againe this expoſition is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to thoſe foure heads of godly deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meditation: to wit, what bleſsings we are to craue in this petition: what euills we are to pray againſt: for what benefits we muſt giue thanks: what contrarie ſinns of ours we muſt acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. And that either in generall and for the whole Church, or in particular for our ſelues and for others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giue vs this day our daily bread.]</hi> That we may come to the true meaning of this petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, firſt we are to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the words. And firſt of all,
<note place="margin">Lechem.</note> the word tranſlated <hi>bread,</hi> doth properly ſignifie ordinarie bread for foode, which is cut and chawed; as when there is diſtinctly named bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 3. King. 13.9. <hi>Bread and wine,</hi> Gen. 14.18.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11241:37"/>
               <hi>wheat, bread, and meate,</hi> Gen. 45.23. But by a Metonimie it is taken for corne whereof bread is made, Gen. 47.13. pſal.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 104.15.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and by a ſynecdoche for any kinde of meate, as 4. King. 6.22. <hi>Set before them bread and water:</hi> then it followeth, <hi>and he made great preparation for them.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken for the whole prouiſion of a banket in meate and drinke: as Luk. 14.1. <hi>to eate bread with one.</hi> Exod. 18.12. Alſo goates milke is called bread, Prov. 27.27. The roote of Iuniper is called bread. Yea fodder for cattell is called bread, pſal. 147.9. and the fruit of trees is called bread, Ier. 11.19. So that by the name of bread in this petition, we vnderſtand all things that belong and are neceſſarie to the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the bodie and of this life. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, Math. 6.25. Iacob, Gen. 28.20. and Paul. 1.

Thoſe things alſo whereby prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is gotten, as husbandrie, traffique, and ſuch like, are comprehended vnder the name [bread.] Prov. 31.14. And becauſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:11241:38"/>our Sauiour Chriſt in this petition would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain al bodily things which are requiſite for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t leading of this life: as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iſac praieth for his wife, Gen. 25.21. the Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to pray for the magiſtrate, that we may lead a quiet life in all godlines and honeſtie, 1. Tim. 2.2. And Salomon praieth for ſeaſonable weather, and for the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the earth, 3. King. 8.36. therefore the word <hi>bread</hi> in this petition, may well be taken in a larger ſenſe, for all thoſe things which are required to the neceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, peaceable, and honeſt ordering of this life, in the common wealth, in the familie, in the fruitfulnes of the earth, in ſeaſonable weather, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Further, whereas Chriſt calleth this bread <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; it is not agreed on among all, what that word doth properly ſignifie. Before Ieromes time, the latin tranſlation had <hi>panem quotidiaenum, our daily bread:</hi> taking the reaſon of their interpretation without all doubt out of Luke, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <gap reason="foreign">

Ierome tranſlated it, <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiall,</hi> whome Ambroſe followeth in the <hi>fift booke of the Sacraments:</hi> adding, that this is not the bread which goeth into the bodie, but the bread of eternal life, Ioh. 6.40. which ſuſteineth the ſubſtance of the ſoule.

And becauſe Chriſt forbiddeth vs to be carefull about temporal prouiſion for the morrow, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he expoundeth it, that Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to aske, not the bread of this preſent life, but foode for the life to come. And he giueth this reaſon. It is not like that Chriſt in ſo ſpirituall a praier to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11241:39"/>father, ſpake of corporall breade which the very Heathen receiue from their parents. But this reaſon is not good: for God will haue vs to caſt vpon him, not onely our care of ſpirituall things, but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all our care, 1. Pet. 5.7. <hi>And our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father knoweth that we haue neede euen of theſe temporall things,</hi> Math. 6.23. He will haue vs to acknowledge, that it is he which giueth vnto vs thoſe things which belong to our daily foode: and he is angrie if any ſhall thinke, that he hath receiued theſe things els where then from him, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. 2.8. Ioel 2.23. He hath alſo commanded vs to aske theſe things of him, 3. King. 8.35. Iacob, Gen. 28.20. and Salomon, Prov. 30.7. haue asked thoſe things in praier. And ſeeing the Lords praier is a perfect forme of praier, containing all things God will haue vs to aske of him; it is neceſſarie that ſome place ſhould be left for daily bread, conſidering it is not contained in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other petition. Againe, it were great impietie, either to aſcribe thoſe things which belong to our daily foode to the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:11241:40"/>creature, or to our owne induſtrie, or elſe to aske the ſame in praier of the Saints, and not to thinke them to be the gift of God. Therefore the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>In this petition therefore we are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and taught, that mens affaires in this common outward life, are not turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout raſhly and by chance; that bodily goods, and outward wealth, whatſoeuer belongs to the happie eſtate of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth and of the familie, doe not depend vpon the wiſdome, diligence, and dexteritie of men: neither are they to be imputed vnto blinde fortune, vnto deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, or to the courſe of ſecundarie cauſes: but God himſelfe doth diſpoſe &amp; gouerne all theſe things according to his good pleaſure. For vnles God keepe the citie, and build the houſe, men labour in vaine, Pſal. 127.1. So in Daniel we ſhall finde, how the ſtates of kingdomes are diſpoſed of God.

Neither may we thinke that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued from himſelfe, as things not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming his high maieſtie, the care of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:11241:42"/>temporall, and earthly bleſsings, and hath diſtributed the charge thereof amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Saints: for he doth ſeriouſly affirme, that proſperitie and aduerſitie euen in theſe things, doth come from him, Levit. 26.3. Deutr. 28.12. And he is angrie if we doe not acknowledge the ſame, Hoſe. 2.8. Ioel 2.23. Our Sauiour Chriſt aſcribeth vnto our heauenly father, the care of our ſoule and bodie, of our life, foode, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Matth. 6.32. Nay he ſaith, that he <hi>hath numbred the haires of our head,</hi> Mat. 10.30. And therefore we are commanded to craue of him in praier the beſtowing of theſe bleſsings, and the remooueall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from calamities, and if theſe things thus happen vnto vs, by heartie thankſgiuing to acknowledge them for his peculiar bleſsings. Withall we pray, that God would take from vs all vngodly care, doubting, diſtruſt, and couetouſnes. That we may be vndoubtedly perſwaded, that our heauenly father is both willing and able to giue daily bread vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that in quietnes and hope may be our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:11241:43"/>ſtrength. Thus Moſes praieth for the fruits of the earth, Deutr. 26.15. In the ſtorie of the Goſpel, the diſeaſed leapers, the blinde, &amp;c. doe pray. Iſaac, Gen. 25.11. and Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, 1. Sam. 1.11. pray againſt barrenneſſe. Paul praieth for Magiſtrates, 1. Tim. 2.2. Ieremie for the peace of the citie, Ier. 29.7. And becauſe God wil haue vs to labour and to vſe ordinarie meanes for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſuch things, we pray that he would lay ſuch things before vs, and bleſſe them, that he would giue increaſe vnto him that planteth, and to him that watereth, 1. Cor. 3.6. for the bleſsing of the Lord maketh rich without adding ſorow thereto, Prov. 10.22. And becauſe we are commanded to aske <hi>Daily bread,</hi> it teacheth vs that we may not pray for delights, for ſtore, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, to ſerue for riot and for pride. And in a word, according to <hi>Salomons</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, Prov. 30.7. we pray that we may not be ouercharged with too much wealth, nor oppreſſed with ouermuch want. And <hi>Salomon</hi> there addeth, that we doe alſo pray againſt thoſe euills or ſinnes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:11241:43"/>which ariſe of exceſſe either in wealth or pouertie. Likewiſe according to S. Paul, Philip. 4.18. and 1. Tim. 6.6. we praie for contentation, for a godly and wholſome vſe of euery eſtate, that our ſoule doe not loath Manna, nor we deſire the fleſh pots of Egypt, nor quailes grudgingly, Numb. 11.5. but may referre it to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to diſtribute of the fiſhes among the companie, ſo much as he will, Ioh. 6.11. for to this petition alſo belongs that which went before, that the fathers will be done. Nowe we call this <hi>[our bread]</hi> not for that it is gotten by our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, or is due vnto vs by ſome kinde of right, but becauſe God of his goodneſſe hath ordained and appointed the ſame for the ſuſtenance of this life, and ſo is made ours by the free gift of God, or els becauſe it is neceſſarie to euery one in regard of his calling. Againe God hath decreed what and how much he will diſpence to euery one out of his treaſures of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And becauſe S. Paul oppoſeth againſt the idle, and againſt vnlawfull meanes to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:11241:44"/>get foode, the commandement of labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that euery one may eate his owne bread, Eph. 4.28. 2. Theſſ. 3.8. we doe alſo well vnderſtand our bread, of that which is not violently taken from others by wrong, or gotten from others in idlenes, but as it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt eate the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of thy hands.</hi> Againe, when as we pray for <hi>[our bread,]</hi> it teacheth vs to be carefull alſo for the neceſsities of others. Yea, that thoſe things which are giuen to me and giuen to thee, are ſo beſtowed vpon vs, that we ſhould impart thereof vnto other, Eph. 4.28. for it is not mine or thine, but [our bread.] And therefore it is the poore mans bread which thou detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, when thou doeſt not beſtow it on the poore. This bread we are commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to pray for <hi>[this day,]</hi> Math. 6.12. Luke ſaith, for the day, and daily: to teach vs, that God hath care ouer vs euery moment. And this very word <hi>[This day]</hi> ſerues to be a bridle to all fooliſh and vngodly care for the morrow, whereby a man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine and moderate that exceſsiue deſire
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11241:44"/>after the things of this life wherewith al of vs are troubled. And we may not thinke, when we haue ſome goods and wealth in readines, as it were in a treaſury, that then we neede not to make this petition, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then alſo muſt we euery day vſe this praier, that we may acknowledge our ſtore to be the gift of God, and our ſelues to be the Lords beggers, as Auſtine ſaith: and that thoſe things which are alreadie giuen vs may be kept ſafe: but eſpecially, that out of thoſe things that he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he may make daily ſupply of things neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs, with a bleſsing, whereby he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſtrength to bread for the ſuſtenance of this life, and cauſeth the vſe thereof to be holeſome vnto vs: leſt that ſhould come to paſſe which is written, Levit. 26.26. <hi>Ye ſhall eate and not be ſatisfied.</hi> Ezek. 4.16. <hi>I will breake the ſtaffe of bread, ye ſhall eate with care and with aſtoniſhment:</hi> leſt we ſhould be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the number of thoſe that ſeeke for, and receiue, their goodes, &amp; their whole portion in this life, and are barred from the inheritance of heauenly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11241:45"/>and eternall bleſsings, Pſal. 17.14. Luke, 16.25. <hi>Which are fatted for the day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Ier. 12.3. The auncient writers as may be gathered by their interpretations, read ſimply <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, to day.] And yet with Ariſtotle, politic. 2. βίος ὁ καθ' ἡμέραν, ſignifieth daily foode. Alſo, our Sauiour Chriſt to put vs in mind of this petition, hath obſerued and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed this cuſtome, in that before meate he bleſſed it and gaue thankes, Math. 14.19. and 15.36. and Luke, 24.31. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul ſaith, Tim. 4.2. <hi>It is a doctrine of deuils, that biddeth men abſtaine from meates, which God hath created to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the faithfull with thankeſgiuing. And nothing ought to be refuſed, if it be receiued with thankeſgiuing: for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſanctified by the word and praier.</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:11241:45"/>Where by word, he vnderſtandeth that word of God, by which the vſe and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment of the creatures, which were created for our good, was giuen to men in the beginning. Gen. 1.8. and after it was loſt by ſinne, was reſtored againe by the interceſsion of the ſonne, Gen. 9.2. And whereby the difference of meates is taken away in the newe teſtament. Coloſ. 2.16. <hi>That all things may be pure,</hi> Titus, 1.15 By prayer alſo, he vnderſtandeth that wherby as adopted children we craue that our owne bread may be giuen vnto vs from the bountifull hand of our father with his bleſsing, that ſo the vſe thereof may pleaſe God, and we may inioy the ſame with ioyfull and good conſcience. For this alſo is the ſpeciall gift of God, as Salomon ſaith: <hi>To eate of his owne bread, to drinke and to reioyce,</hi> Eccleſ. 3.12. and 5.17.</p>
            <p>Thus are theſe things to be asked in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall for the whole body of the Church, priuately for our ſelues, and namely for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whoſe neceſsity we knowe, that ſo we may apply this petition to the foure
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11241:46"/>generall heads before ſet downe. I. What bleſsings we are to aske. II. What euills we are to pray againſt, that they may be remooued, taken away, and we deliuered from them. III. For what benefits we are to be thankefull vnto God. IV. What ſinnes of ours we muſt acknowledge and confeſſe vnto god in this petition for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and amendment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forgiue vs our debts.]</hi> The asking of daily bread is not therefore put before the remiſsion of ſinnes in the order of prayer, as though money were to be ſought for in the firſt place, and godlineſſe learned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wealth is gotten. For our Sauiour Chriſt biddeth vs <hi>firſt ſeeke the kingdome of God,</hi> Mat. 6.33. But becauſe we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally carried to ſeeke worldly goods, and it is the will of god, that his benefits ſhould take footing in vs in earthly things, and thence lift vp the minde to the knowledge of god, and to the deſire of ſpirituall and heauenly bleſsings: So Ioh. 4.53. <hi>The ruler with all his family was brought to beleeue in Chriſt, by the outward curing of his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:11241:46"/>ſonne,</hi> and Gen. 28.20. Iacob ſaith, <hi>If God will keepe me in my iourney, and giue me foode and raiment, the Lord ſhall be my god.</hi> Therefore after the petition for bread, is ſtraight ioyned the petition for remiſsion of ſinnes, and they are knit together by this copulatiue particle [καὶ, and,] to teach vs, that with what earneſt deſire, we are naturally carried to ſeeke worldly goods, with the like feruency of ſpirit, we ſhould deſire &amp; care for thoſe things, which concerne the eternall ſaluation of our ſoules: and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall deſire of bodily goodes and wealth, which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding Chriſt in this prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er doth reſtraine and moderate, may alſo teach vs this by the coniunction copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue καὶ that we muſt pray for food to god, and referre the iſſue and euent to his good pleaſure, as hath beene ſaide.</p>
            <p>Nowe thoſe which Mathewe calleth [debts,] Luke, expoundeth [Sinnes] that we may knowe what kinde of debts are vnderſtood in this place. And it is a vſuall Ghaldaeiſme, to vſe the word <hi>Chab</hi> which ſignifieth to be indebted or bound to, for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:11241:47"/>to ſinne, to do wickedly. And Chriſt in his ſermons oft times putteth debt for ſinnes, offences, and wickedneſſe: as in the parable Math. 18.24. In the ſtory of the ſinfull woman, Luke. 7.47. And Luk. 13. v. 2. <hi>Thinke ye that thoſe on whome the tower of Silo fell, were greater debters then the reſt?</hi> Here then this phraſe is to be marked and we muſt conſider what inſtructions we muſt learne from this, that ſinnes are called debts. For ſeeing that men do either frame vnto themſelues ſinnes, from priuate ſuperſtition and from the traditions men, or elſe from ſome Phariſaicall conceit doe challenge vnto themſelues iuſtice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: this name [debt] doth lead vs vnto the lawe or decaloge, as it were to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, which is the rule of Gods iuſtice, ſhewing, what our nature ought to be, what we ought to doe and what to omit, in what manner, with what perfection &amp; puritie. As Chriſt ſaith, Luke, 17.10. <hi>vve haue done thoſe things vvhich vve were commaunded to doe.</hi> And Rom. 8.12. <hi>vve are debters to liue after the ſpirite.</hi> And
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:11241:47"/>becauſe that is the forme of our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto God: it ſheweth vs by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, how many waies we runne into excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great debt, by doing thoſe things, which we ought not to doe, by leauing vndone thoſe things which we ought to doe, and ſuch things as we performe, by doing them amiſſe, imperfectly, &amp; impure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The ſame phraſe alſo ſignifieth a fault, guiltineſſe, an offence, and condemnation: as there are many examples, when as for want of paying a debt one is condemned to ſome puniſhment: ſo the greeks vſe the worde <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifieth to owe: as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to owe a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or forfeiture: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: thoſe that are conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned to die: or conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned in a ſumme of money. So Chriſt expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth this, Mat. 5.25. <hi>thou ſhalt be caſt into priſon, and not come thence, till thou haſt paid the vttermoſt farthing,</hi> Math. 18.25. <hi>When he had nothing to pay his maſter commaunded him to be ſoulde with all that he had.</hi> So that this very phraſe teacheth vs, to aske forgiueneſſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11241:48"/>both of the fault and of the puniſhment, contrary to the diſtinction of the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Now for what ende the Lord doth oft times lay vpon the Godly in this life, after the ſinne is forgiuen, temporall puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, not of curſes, but of correction, we haue ſhewed elſe where. And becauſe the Lord inioyneth his Apoſtles, &amp; thoſe who haue god for their father, to make this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for pardon of ſinne euery day, as we pray daily for bread: it ſheweth againſt the Pelagians, that no child of God is perfect &amp; without ſinne in this life, who hath not neede euery day to humble himſelfe and pray for the pardon of his ſinnes. It ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo againſt the Nonatians, that they, which ſinne after baptiſme, and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may obtaine pardon if they turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and repent: for they which are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and reconciled vnto god, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to pray for the pardon of their ſinnes: &amp; looke what we aske in his name, by his commaundement, he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with an oath to giue the ſame vnto vs. The one whereof, (that is, the doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:11241:48"/>the Pelagians,) doth put vs in mind of our owne weaknes euery day, &amp; ſerues to bring vs to humilitie. The other, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the mercie and pardon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is offered vnto vs euery day, if we turne vnto him, ſerues to ſtrengthen our faith that we ſhould not deſpaire. And this mercie and pardon we are commanded to ſeeke for by praier, not of the angels, or of Saints, but of God himſelfe, in the vſe of thoſe meanes by which God will giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſinns. And becauſe we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pray for the forgiuenes of our debts, in this very thing, we doe humbly confeſſe before God, againſt <hi>Popiſh Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> that we cannot make ſufficient paiment or ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, but altogether haue neede of free pardon for our Mediatours ſake. And becauſe our ſinnes <hi>make a ſeparation betvveene God and vs,</hi> Iſa. 59.2. therefore we craue in this petition the fauour of God, reconciliation, and acceptance. And whoſoeuer ſeeketh for theſe things, either by ſatisfactions or by merits, otherwiſe then from the meere
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:11241:49"/>mercie of the father, for the paiment, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and merit of Chriſt alone, doth not ſeeke them well neither ſhall euer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto them: for we are commanded to aske the forgiuenes of our debts: and the worde [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>forgiue</hi>] is oppoſed to our paiment, to our recompence and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and ſignifieth a free gift. For the Greekes tranſlate the Hebrew worde <hi>Salach</hi> which ſignifieth to be ſauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and of mercie to pardon, by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Dan. 9.9. <hi>Vnto God belong mercies and pardons.</hi> Numb. 14.19. <hi>Pardon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie of the people according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing thus expounded theſe things, we may eaſily obſerue what we are to aske in this petition. VVe pray therefore becauſe our debts are innumerable, infinite and vnmeaſurable, that God will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into iudgement with them, that he wil not impure them vnto vs, that he will not marke them, or require them at our hands, but for Chriſt his ſake mercifully to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, <hi>to caſt them behinde his backe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:11241:49"/>euen into the bottome of the ſea.</hi> Iſa. 53.6. Mich. 7.19. And becauſe the wages of ſinne are the diſpleaſure, the wrath or anger of God, the curſe of God and condemnation, with the puniſhments of this curſe in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and ſoule, in this life, and in the life to come, euen eternall death: we therefore beſeech the Lord to aſſwage his deſerued wrath, not to kindle it againſt vs, or poure it out vpon vs; to lay aſide his indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and embrace vs with fauour and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to become and to continue vnto vs a gratious and mercifull father, and rewarde vs not according to our ſinnes, neither lay vpon vs the puniſhment of his curſe, nor caſt vs into priſon till we haue made ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, Math. 5.25. and 18.34. but pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning both the fault and the puniſhment of our ſinnes, to ſet vs free from the bonde or obligation thereto, that we may ſay with Paul, <hi>Who ſhall accuſevs? vvho ſhall condemne vs? It is God that iuſtifieth and forgiueth, who ſhall condemne?</hi> Rom. 8.33. And ſeeing they are not generally debts or ſinnes, but <hi>[Our debts,]</hi> therefore euery
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:11241:50"/>one that is to pray, muſt conſider in each commaundement of the law, what ſinnes he hath runne into and committed, he muſt diſtinctly obſerue whether they be ſinnes of preſumption, Pſal. 19.14. or ſinnes of infirmitie and weaknes: for ſo ſhall we rightly pray for pardon, according to the difference of our ſinnes. And becauſe ſinne is neuer forgiuen vnles we doe repent, Ier. 5.7. and we of our ſelues are careleſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our hard heart which can not repent, we doe not weigh and conſider and count our ſinnes, how many, how great and how grieuous they be, we doe not earneſtly grieue for our ſinnes, nor from our heart deteſt and forſake them, we doe not turne from them, but delight in our ſinnes, and declare the ſame as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Iſa. 3.9. we haue not the ſeare of God before our eyes, neither be affected with the ſenſe of Gods wrath: therefore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we pray for the pardon of our ſinnes, we doe withall intreat, that God by his ſpirit would caſt out of vs all ſecuritie, that ſinne may not ſleepe or lie dead in vs, but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:11241:50"/>may be raiſed by the Law: that he would take from vs our ſtonie and impenitent heart, and giue vnto vs a fleſhie and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant heart, which may acknowledge and deteſt it owne ſinnes, which may bewaile the ſame and feare in the ſenſe &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the wrath of God. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we doe alſo praie, that he would lift vs vp againe by true faith, and preſerue vs from deſpaire: for by ſaith we receiue the forgiuenes of our ſinnes. And becauſe this petition of forgiuenes of ſinnes is ioyned by a coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> copulatiue vnto the fourth petition, where we pray for daily bread for the day; therefore we are commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make this petition for the pardon of our ſinnes euery day, and withall we be admoniſhed to take heede that we do not ſo heape our ſinnes, <hi>that we ſhall be found in the bookes of Gods iudgement,</hi> Dan. 7.10. <hi>without forgiuenes:</hi> but we muſt euery day pray <hi>that our daily ſinnes may be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, that they be not written vvith a penne of yron, and that we may not heape vp vnto our ſelues wrath againſt the day of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:11241:51"/>wrath,</hi> Rom. 2.5. And becauſe God hath appointed and ordained certaine meanes whereby he will beſtow and we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the forgiuenes of ſinnes, therefore we doe likewiſe pray, that God would giue vs ſuch a minde, whereby we may not contemne or neglect, but daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the vſe of the kaies of heauen, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word, the vſe of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and other exerciſes of faith and praier: <hi>that God vvould not giue vs vp to a reprobate ſenſe, voide of all griefe, not regarding our ſinnes or the wrath of god,</hi> Rom. 1.28. Eph. 4.17. And laſtly we pray, that we may not be preuented by death, before our ſinnes be remitted and forgiuen: and that before the ende of this life, we may vſe thoſe meanes whereby the pardon of our ſinnes may ordinarily be graunted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Theſe ſo many and ſo great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings muſt we conceiue in our mind when we pray <hi>[forgiue vs our ſinnes:]</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may plainely ſee, what deuotion and intention of minde is required in the very act of praier.</p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:11241:51"/>
            <p>Now all theſe things we muſt aske for the whole bodie of the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, priuately for our ſelues, and namely for thoſe whoſe neceſsitie we know: for we ſay [<hi>Our debts,</hi> or treſpaſſes.] And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the three latter petitions be depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie, that is, ſuch wherein we pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt euills, yet they may be well applied to the foure generall heads ſet downe in the beginning, and ſo ought to be.

               <hi>As we forgiue our debters.]</hi> Luke hath it thus, [καὶ γὰρ ἀυτοὶ, for we alſo forgiue.] Now we muſt not take the ſimilitude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Matthew, to be equall altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as though God ſhould forgiue with no more perfect meaſure of mercie, then we forgiue others: for the fleſh fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit in vs, euen then when we
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:11241:52"/>are reconciled to our neighbour. And God himſelfe ſheweth inequalitie between them, Oſe. 11.8. <hi>I ſhould make thee as Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma and Zeboim, but I will not execute the fiercenes of my wrath, for I am God and not man.</hi> And ſpeaking of a moſt ſeruent loue of a mother, Iſa. 49.15. he ſaith, <hi>Though a mother ſhould forget her childe, yet will not I forget thee.</hi> Neither doth Luke goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſet downe the cauſe or reaſon, by which and for which we deſerue the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſinnes. For it is the free pardon of God proceeding of his meere loue and compaſsion towardes vs, Matth. 18. v. 27. And Paul vſeth the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God of his meere fauour hath freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned you: for he oppoſeth not our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing vnto God, as any price or deſert, that therefore God ſhould forgiue vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue forgiuen others before. But he ſaith, Eph. 4.32. <hi>be ye curteous one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and tender hearted, freely forgiuing one another, euen as God for Chriſts ſake freely forgaue you</hi> Coloſ. 3.13. <hi>Forbearing and forgiuing one another: like as Chriſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:11241:52"/>forgaue: euen ſo doe you.</hi> So that this phraſe doth not import the cauſe, whereon the pardon of God dependeth, but as Cyprian ſaith, <hi>it is a condition and pledge thereof.</hi> For as children are moſt commonly made worſe by the too gentle intreating of the parents: ſo our corrupt fleſh, hearing that gods pardon is alwaies ready for thoſe which pray vnto him for it and repent, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth libertie thence to ſinne more freely afterward, in hope of obtaining pardon eaſily. And thus doe we abuſe that endleſſe benefit of Gods free pardon, as though it were ſome priuiledge of filthines and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull libertie. Therefore Chriſt, by this clauſe here added, doth binde the intent and purpoſe of them that pray, as it were by a publike condition and promiſe, that they will hereafter beware of all ſinne, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their life, and follow after godlines. It is therefore a moſt weightie admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by way of a vowe or promiſe in the ſight of our heauenly father, that we doe not abuſe this fatherly gentleneſſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to forgiue, vnto libertie of ſinning:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:11241:53"/>but do promiſe and as it were vow ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life. And that generall doctrine concerning this good purpoſe of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, Chriſt propoundeth in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall example of forgiuing one another in brotherly ſort, very fitly agreeing to the wordes of this petition, as we haue ſaide, Math. 5.39. about turning to the other cheeke. And becauſe the fleſh beeing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt with a roote of bitterneſſe. Heb. 12.13. and of it ſelfe full of impatience, deſirous of reuenge, perſiſting in anger, is moſt farre from reconciliation &amp; forgiueneſſe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do alſo pray that this roote of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe may be loſſened, beaten downe &amp; mortified in vs by the holy Ghoſt: and a loue of vnitie, reconciliation and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be kindled in vs, that this may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be imputed vnto vs, that we haue not forgiuen one another with all our heart, but haue had the fleſh ſtill ſtriuing againſt it.</p>
            <p>And becauſe we cannot liue in this world without many ſinnes againſt the Lord, neither conuerſe among our bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:11241:53"/>without many offences one againſt another: therefore Chriſt ioyned both theſe together in this fiſt petition, that ſo both peace of conſcience towards God, by the continuall forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and brotherly charity, wherewith God is chiefly delighted might be preſerued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men by continuall reconciliation &amp; forgiuing one another. And therfore doth he ioyne brotherly pardoning with gods forgiuing, as he ſheweth in the parable, Mat. 18.23. Which doth moſt plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this petition that he may the more forcibly breake and correct the wicked impatience and bitterneſſe of our heart, &amp; that he may take from vs all thoſe reaſons which we are woont to pretend and heap vp very gloriouſly in the defence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge as it were by our owne right, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the greatneſſe and multitude of our neighboures offences, concerning our owne credite, and the benefites we haue beſtowed vpon our neighbour, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the debts which we that are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants do owe vnto god, with the debts of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11241:54"/>fellow-ſeruantes, where for the moſt part cach one oweth ſomething vnto another. For either we doe ignorantly and at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares giue the occaſion vnto our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure when he offendeth vs: or els beeing offended and hurt doe ſinne againe in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and bitterneſſe. Wherevpon S. Iames ſaith, <hi>Confeſſe your ſinnes one vnto another, and pray one for another.</hi> Iames, 5.16. And leſt we ſhould be offended at our neighbour for his often offending of vs, and be wearied with renewing our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and reconcilings ſo often times, we haue beene taught before, that we muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day repeat vnto god that petition <hi>[Forgiue vs our debts:]</hi> that we might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue our neighbour, <hi>not vnto ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times but vnto ſeauentie ſeauen times.</hi> And by this forme of condition and promiſe, <hi>[eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we alſo forgiue]</hi> he doth moſt notably prouoke and pricke vs. forward to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous and ready to forgiue our breethren. That we might remember our ſelues to falſify our faith ſolemnely giuen and bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in this petition, vnles we doe forgiue our
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:11241:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>neighbour; and may alſo know that we pray for the vengeance of god againſt our ſelues without compaſsion of forgiuenes. And ſo, as Chryſoſtome ſaith, <hi>We doe not pray vnto God, but prouoke God, we doe not obtaine fauour, but we pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation againſt our ſelues, and at the laſt iudgement ſhall be iudged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſentence, when we ſay [eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we alſo forgiue.]</hi> For by this meanes God is mooued to withdrawe and holde backe the benefite of remiſsion of ſinnes, as the parable ſaith, Mat. 18.34. Neither doth this ſhift any whit helpe vnmercifull men that (as Chryſoſt. writeth) ſome men when they pray omitte that promiſe: or that ſome do in the meane time vſe other prayer where that clauſe is not to be had: Nay by this wile wherby they goe about to deceiue God himſelfe, they deſerue the greater indignation. For that ſentence of God abideth ſure, <hi>If ye will not forgiue men their treſpaſſes, neither will your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father forgiue you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>debters</hi> here according to the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:11241:55"/>phraſe before expounded, we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe that haue offended vs, which haue done ſomthing againſt vs, or as Paul expoundeth it, Coloſ. 3.13. <hi>againſt whome we haue ſome quarrell.</hi> And Saint Luke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>[we forgiue euery man that is indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs.]</hi> For ſeeing by nature we are woont to be more eaſie and gentle vnto ſome, and harder againſt others, and doe with leſſe ſorrowe and griefe beare thoſe iniuries and wronges which are done vnto vs by greate men, then thoſe which are done by our equalls or inferiours: therefore he taketh away all reſpect in this brotherly forgiuing, when he ſaith <hi>[we forgiue euery one that is indebted to vs.]</hi> &amp; here he ſpeaketh not properly and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of ciuill debt, though that alſo is to be forgiuen, or at leaſt borne with, if it can not be demanded and paid, without the loſſe and ouerthrow of our neighbour, as the parable plainely teacheth vs, Mat. 18.33. Therefore Auſtine doth well adviſe vs, more to eſchewe the hatred of our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then other ſinnes: <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:11241:55"/>which thou headeſt offended in other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and deſires, might here be cured, when thou ſaiſt, [Forgiue vs our debts.] but thine implacable hatred, and deſire of reuenge ſpoiles vnto thee that, which is added, [Euen as we forgiue others:] and that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoiled, all thy ſinnes are retained and nothing forgiuen.</hi> Nowe he that did the wronge, and he that is wronged, both are enioyned to be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled: Mat. 5.23. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee,</hi> that is, hath any quarrell againſt thee, as beeing wronged by thee: <hi>goe thy way, &amp; firſt be reconciled to thy brother.</hi> For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance thou canſt not deale with God, or aske forgiueneſſe. And he which hath the wrong done vnto him is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Luk. 17.4. <hi>If thy brother ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee ſeauen times in a day, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imes in a day turne againe to thee: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it repeteth me, thou ſhalt forgiue him, yea not vnto ſeven times, but vnto ſeuenty ſeuen times: and whatſoeuer is thus looſed in earth, ſhall be alſo looſed in heauen.</hi> Mar.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:11241:56"/>18.18. But if thy brother who hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee repent not, though thou forgiue him, yet God in heauen doth not forgiue him, ſeeing he repenteth not. So that Chriſt ſpeaketh of publike reconciliation, Luk. 17.3. And his meaning is not, that we may or ought to keepe and exerciſe our anger, hatred, and bitternes, that is, not forgiue our aduerſarie, vnleſſe he doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and aske thee forgiueneſſe. For the commandement is generall, Mark. 11.25. <hi>When ye ſhall ſtandready to pray, forgiue if ye haue any quarell againſt any man, that your heauenly father may alſo forgiue you.</hi> Therefore in heart we doe forgiue our debters priuatly, euen when they repent not, neither aske vs forgiuenes. Now this brotherly forgiueneſſe containeth thus much, that we ſhould either not conceiue anger or hatred againſt our neighbour which wrongeth vs vniuſtly; or elſe that we ſhould lay aſide, and put away anger, hatred, and enmity conceiued againſt our neighbour for wrong done vnto vs: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that we ſhould neither take revenge
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:11241:56"/>neither thinke vpon, or indeauour to take reuenge vpon our neighbour; nay, not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet or deſire that either God himſelfe or any other ſhould lay temporall or eternall puniſhment on him for wrong done vnto vs, vnleſſe order of iuſtice ſo require. But we muſt rather wiſh them godly amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that beeing conuerted they may be ſaued eternally, and not be condemned: and if they haue not repented, we muſt deſire that they may in time be chaſtened and corrected in pitie and compaſsion, with fatherly ſcourges of bitte and bridle, that ſo they may be ſpared eternally. And thus we ought to loue our enemies, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying for all things that may further them vnto ſaluation, and to pray for them that perſecute vs, that this ſinne may not be laid vnto their charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And lead vs not into temptation]</hi> There be diuers kinds of temptations. For God is ſaid to tempt, but yet vnto good, when as by ſetting before vs ſome perill, by ſending ſome aduerſitie, or by deferring helpe and deliuerance, he trieth, exerciſeth, &amp; proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:11241:57"/>our amendment, our faith, hope, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, obedience and conſtancie. But temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or allurement vnto euill commeth either from the deuill, or from the fleſh, or from the world. And the deuill properly is called the tempter, 1. Theſſ. 3.5. leaſt the tempter had tempted you: to wit, when either by inward ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or els by ſome outward occaſions of proſperitie or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, either on the right hand or on the left, he goeth about to draw vs from that which is good, or to ſeduce vs vnto euill. The fleſh tempteth vnto euill, when we are allured and drawne away by our own euill concupiſcence, that luſt might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſinne, and ſinne bring forth death. The world tempteth either by euill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as it were by laying ſtumbling blocks or offences before vs, or els by wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions. And as auncient writers ſay; the world flattereth, that it may deceiue: or terrifieth, that it may confound vs. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſuch temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comes either by ſuch things as are pleaſant, delectable, and to be deſired, through couetouſneſſe, wicked
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:11241:57"/>hope and loue: or els by thoſe things that are ſorrowfull, fearefull &amp; terrible, in feare, dread and flight. And to explane the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this petition, that diſtinction of Gregorie is very fitte: that <hi>temptation is cauſed by ſuggestion, by delight, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo of ancient writers is very conuenient for this purpoſe: ſaying, that the deuil vſeth theſe wiles, theſe crafts and deceits in temptations to ouerthrow them that are wiſe and ſtrong. I. When affliction continueth long, and deliuerance is deferred. II. VVhen the miſerie ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth too exceeding great, ſingular, and ſtrange. III. VVhen vnder the colour of ſom great good, he doth cloſely mooue a man to take in hand ſome thing which is either very dangerous, or els beyond our ſtrength and calling. IV. VVhen he doth cloake and couer vice vnder the name of vertue, as couetouſnes vnder the colour of prouidence: crueltie vnder the colour of iuſtice: pride is painted vnder the name of abraue minde: ignorance is counted ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:11241:58"/>waſt or prodigalitie is taken for liberalitie, &amp;c. V. He abuſeth peace, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes, and reſt, to bring them by little and little vnto ſecuritie. Now here we are not commanded to pray that God would not make triall of vs by his temptations: <hi>for we reioyce in tribulation, knowing that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction bringeth forth patience, and patience triall, and triall hope,</hi> Rom. 5.4. Iam. 1. v. 2. <hi>Count it exceeding great ioy when ye fall into diuers temptations.</hi> Neither doe we pray that we may be altogether free from the darts of ſatan, of the fleſh, &amp; the world. <hi>For he that is not tempted, vvhat doth he know?</hi> ſaith the ſonne of Syrach, chap. 34.10. and Auſtin vpon the 60. pſal. ſaith, <hi>By temptation comes our increaſe. For no man knovves himſelfe but he that is tempted. No man can be crowned but he that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth: nor ouercome vnleſſe he ſtriue: neither can he ſtrine vnleſſe he haue ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and thoſe that will prooue him.</hi> And in the 14. <hi>booke of the citie of God,</hi> he ſaith: <hi>If we haue no temptations nor troubles at all, while vve beare about the frailtie of this life, we liue not well.</hi> And very well
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:11241:58"/>may this be vnderſtood of the prayer of Chriſt, Iohn, 17.15. where he ſaith: <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou keepe them from euill.</hi> So that the wordes of this petition haue not this ſenſe: <hi>that we may not be tempted:</hi> but <hi>[that we may not be lead into te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:]</hi> And as Bernard noteth out of Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, it is one thing to be tempted, or aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with temptation: and another thing to be lead into temptation, to witte, when we are laid open vnto temptation and are exerciſed therewith: and another thing to be caried into te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation, to wit, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being opreſſed and ouerwhelmed with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we fall downe vnder it, and are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thereby, either conſenting or yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wholly vnto it. Or els, to be lead into temptation is to be delighted with the ſuggeſtion of ſome ſinne: to be carried wholly into it, is to giue full conſent to the temptation. Now Chriſt vſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifieth, not ſo much to lead into, as to carry into: as Auſtine alſo obſerued, when any thing is ſaide to be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:11241:59"/>lead or caried into. The Greeke interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tranſlate <hi>Hebi</hi> which commeth of <hi>Bo,</hi> by the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth to bring to, to bring vpon, to lead into, to carie into. And the Hebrew word is vſed in the ſame ſenſe about the worſhipping of the calfe, Exod. 32. v. 21. <hi>Thou haſt brought vpon thy people a great ſinne.</hi> Gen. 26.10. <hi>Thou ſhouldeſt haue brought a treſpaſſe vpon vs.</hi> Gen. 27.12. <hi>I ſhall bring a curſe vpon me and not a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> Pſal. 66.11. <hi>Thou haſt brought vs into a ſnare.</hi> 3. King. 21.29. <hi>I will not bring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in his daies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the phraſe, To lead or carie into temptation, whereupon the meaning of this petition dependeth, may beſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by comparing together the vſe thereof. The Scripture ſpeaketh thus of the aſſault or ſending of temptations. 1. Cor. 10.13. No temptation hath taken, laid hold on, or aſſailed you, but ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to man. Iam 1.2. [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:] which doth not barely ſignifie to fall into temptation, but to runne into, to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:11241:59"/>bite vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And that is yet more grieuous which Paul ſaith, 1. Timoth. 6.6. [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] they fall into temptations as it were into a ſnare, which drowne men in deſtruction and perdition. Luk. 22. v. 40. <hi>Pray, leaſt ye enter into temptation</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] that is, leaſt at vnawares beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided, without armour and fight, ye be wrapped in temptation, which may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome you, yea drowne you. VVhence it is plaine, that we are lead into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when we are left vnto our ſelues, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the helpe of God, and are driuen into, are plunged, thruſt downe, or caſt headlong into the wiles and mightie aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of the deuills temptations, and are ſuffered to be ouerwhelmed therewith, as though we were euery way enſnared in a ginne. And we doe not pray without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming any perſon onely, that we may not be lead into temptation; but ſpeaking vnto our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, we ſay: <hi>[Lead not thou vs into temptation.]</hi> And Auſtin noteth that many read this petition after this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Suffer vs not to be lead into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:11241:60"/>But the meaning is more full, if it be read, Lead vs not, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the deceit of temptation doth farre exceed our weakneſſe: for we fight not with fleſh and blood, but againſt the powers of darkeneſſe, and ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, Eph. 6.12. And there is great danger leſt we ſhould yeeld in temptation and be ouercome, and ſo drowned in perdition. Therefore firſt of all we pray, becauſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath not liberty to tempt vs ſo much either as he would or could doe, but ſo much as God permitteth and giueth him leaue, Iob. 1.12. that our heauenly father would not caſt vs off, and deliuer vs to the luſt, to the treaſons and power of this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but that he would diſpoſe of, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the temptation, and not ſuffer vs to be tempted aboue that, which by his grace and gift we are able to beare, as Paul ſaith, 1. Cor. 10.13. II. When Satan deſireth to tempt vs, or to winnow vs, we pray that our heauenly father would not forſake vs, and leaue vs alone vnto our ſelues, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:11241:60"/>depriue vs of his preſent grace and helpe in the fit of temptation; but that he would be preſent with vs and aſsiſt vs, to driue away, to put backe, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and bridle the deuill, miniſtring ſtrength and courage vnto vs, that beeing ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, Ephe. 6.13. We may beare the temptation, Iam. 1.12. We may withſtand it, 1. Pet. 5.10. and may not yeeld, nor be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, nor faint in the time of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Luk. 8.13. or be ouerwhelmed in perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1. Tim. 6.9. but Ephe. 6.11. diſpatching them al, may be able to fight and ſtand faſt, and in the time of temptation may be kept from euill, Ioh. 17.15. And that Chriſt our mediatour Luke, 22.32. may pray for vs, that our faith, our hope, our patience, our ſtriuing and conſtancy may not faile. III. Becauſe we our ſelues are ſecure, vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and drouſie in time of temptation, not conſidering the wiles and the power of this tempter, and our owne manifold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, neither are we very much care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full about the danger of temptation: we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:11241:61"/>therefore pray, that the Lord himſelfe would raiſe vs out of the ſleepe of ſecurity, as he teacheth his Apoſtles, Luk. 22. v. 46. That we may watch, praying with all carefulneſſe and vehemency, leſt we enter into temptation, that God himſelfe would arme vs, giuing vs wiſdome and ſtrength that, that we may well oppoſe the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt temptations. IV. We pray that god would giue vs patience, conſolation and hope. Rom. 5.4. that howelong or howe grieuouſlie ſoeuer god will haue vs to be tempted, we may be able to beare it, being contented with the grace of god, as it was anſwered to Paul, 2. Cor. 12.9. V. we praie that when we are bound in the ſnare of temptation, and cannot thence deliuer our ſelues, nor find any way out, that he would giue ſuch an iſſue, 1. Cor. 10.13. that me may ſuſtaine and beare it, that it may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs, and turne to the glory of God. VI. Becauſe he knoweth we haue but ſmall ſtrength, we pray that Chriſt would keepe vs from the dangerous and deadly hower of temptation, as it is Apoc. 3.3.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:11241:61"/>VII. We praie that God would keepe vs in the time of temptation, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Peter, and from Sauls diſpaire. VIII. that god in his indignation would not puniſh one ſinne with another, and ſo leade vs into dangerous temptation as he did Dauid. 2. Sam. 24. 1. and 1. Chron. 21. v. 1. and that he would not giue vs vp to the luſts of our owne heart, Pſal. 81.13. or into a reprobate ſenſe, Rom. 1.28. or to hardnes of heart that we ſhould not grieue, Eph. 4.18. And this interpretation beeing gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the ſcripture it ſelfe, is the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt ſafe.</p>
            <p>And theſe things we muſt pray for, in generall for the whole Church, priuately for our ſelues, and namely for others that are tempted, crauing deliuerance from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, praying for bleſsings, giuing thankes for benefits receiued, and confeſsing that we doe not manfully ſtriue againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that we yeeld vnto them, that we doe not prepare our ſelues againſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that we take not the armour of God, that we our ſelues miniſter baites vnto the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:11241:62"/>tempter, we ſweep &amp; dreſſe vp the houſe, Luke, 11.25. we giue our members as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons vnto the tempter, Romans, 6.19. All which points we haue expounded before, and here onely doe briefly point out the leads of inſtructions, leauing to ſet down at large the ful meditations that this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on affoardes. Now this petition contains, a generall confeſsion of the whole Church of the weakeneſſe and infirmity euen of the children of God in this life. For when we pray, that we may not yeeld vnto te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation nor be overcome thereof, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confeſſe, that by our own ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth we are not able to reſiſt any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: but this is the worke of gods grace which muſt follow forthwith, after we haue receiued new ſpiritual ſtrength in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But deliuer vs from euill]</hi> Some would haue this, to be no peculiar petition by it ſelfe: for the aduerſitiue particle which is here vſed, hath this vſe and force, to ioyne two clauſes into one ſentence. So as that which we doe negatiuely pray againſt in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:11241:62"/>the former clauſe <hi>[Lead vs not:]</hi> We doe affirmatiuely pray for the contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in this aduerſitiue clauſe. I meane not to contend with any man about this matter: yet I thinke they doe not amiſſe in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Catechiſme, which for the better inſtructing of the ſimple call this the ſeuenth petition. For it is larger, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth more in it then the ſixt petition co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning temptation. But leauing theſe fruitleſſe contentions, I come to the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>

               </gap> in the common greeke tongue ſignifieth both theſe things. I. To defend, to protect, to keepe and preſerue from euill, that we fall not into it, thus Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vſeth it, Iliad. 10. Where it is ioyned with the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] which both deliuereth vs and keepeth vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wrath to come. Like as Rom. 5.9. in ſteede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is vſed the worde <gap reason="foreign">

And [τὸ ποηρον] in the neuter gender put abſolutely, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity, is ſcarſly vſed in the newe teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But moſt commonly it is ioyned with a ſubſtantiue, as euill men, an euill heart, euill workes, euil thoughts. And yet the greeke interpreters call [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] an euill thing: vnderſtanding either ſinne, as Gene. 39, 9. of adultrie with his maſters wife: or hindrance, danger, loſſe, aduerſity, as 1. Kinges, 25.18. To render euill for good, which in the newe reſtament is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> euill. In this petition therefore we vnderſtand, euill of it ſelfe, in the maſculine gender for the deuill himſelfe. Alſo in the neuter gender, we take it, for ſinne, and for any hurts, dangers, aduerſities, which doe either preſently burden the ſoule, or the bodie, our goods and good name, or elſe are at hand, and hang ouer our head.</p>
            <p>Firſt herefore we pray, ſeeing the deuill walketh about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11241:64"/>whome he may deuoure, that God would mercifully defend, preſerue, keepe, ſaue and protect vs from him, from all his wiles and ſnares and temptations, and from his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie: and if he haue intangled and caught vs in his ſnares and temptations, we pray that God would plucke vs thence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs. II. we pray that god would keepe vs from euery ſinne or evill worke, that we ſall not into ſinne. III. We pray that he would keepe, protect, and defend vs, from the miſeries of the life to come, that is from euerlaſting paines, and from all da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, loſſes, hindrances, and adverſities of this life, of ſoule and body, of goods and good name: that he would ſtoppe, repell, and turne backe theſe things as they be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills: or if we be already laden with theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, we pray that in his mercy he would free and deliuer vs from them. And thoſe things we propound vnto God vnder the name of euill, that is, if he know, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and iudge them to be euill vnto vs, that is, not profitable and holſome, but da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deadly. IV. Becauſe we deſire,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:11241:64"/>many things to be giuen vs, which we iudge good and profitable for vs, as alſo to be preſerued and deliuered from many things, which we ſcarſly know whether they would be profitable vnto vs or not: therfore we adde in the concluſion of this praier; If we aske any thing which he knows and perceiues would not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome but hurtfull for vs, that he would keepe and deliuer vs from euil. V. If God ſee that it is not good and profitable for vs, that he ſhould take from vs the meſſenger of Satan which buffetteth vs, or elſe that we ſhould be kept and deliuered from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, then we pray that he would giue vs patience, obedience, conſolation and hope, that we may acknowledge his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care ouer vs, leaſt that which God ſendeth vpon vs for our good, become hurtfull vnto vs. Like as in former times, they vſed to pray in aduerſitie with very wittie and godly breuitie: <hi>vt Deus aut li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beret, aut mitiget, aut datâ patientiâ ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet:</hi> that God would either deliuer them, or aſſwage their miſerie, or preſerue them
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:11241:65"/>by giuing them patience. VI. Becauſe theſe protections and deliuerances from euill in this life, are not full and perfect but onely in part; for there doe daily ariſe new aſſaults of the deuill, of ſinne and aduerſities as they are laid before vs: therfore we pray that at the length we may be fully, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wholly deliuered and ſet free from all aſſaults and temptations of the deuill, of ſinne, of dangers and aduerſities whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And becauſe this cannot befall vs in this world &amp; in this life, which is a warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and as the Greekes tranſlate it [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] that is, the rouing of a pirate: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we aske eternall life in this praier which we beleeue in the Creede, that we may be tranſlated out of this world, where the deuill is prince, where the earth in this vale of miſerie brings forth thornes and brambles of affliction, into an other world of eternall life, where we ſhall be free and ſafe from all euills, that we may not alwaies thus be ſubiect and lie open to the darrs, and temptations, and aſſaults of the deuill, the world, the fleſh and calamities. So Paul
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11241:65"/>ſaith, Rom. 7.24. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from this bodie of death?</hi> 2. Tim. 4.16. he ſheweth a godly and excellent affection, when he ſaith: <hi>At my defence all men for ſooke me, but the Lord aſsiſted me and I was deliuered out of the mouth of the lyon: and the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me from all euill, and vvill keepe me or preſerue me unto his heauenly kingdom, to whome be praiſe for euer and euer: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> In which wordes he deliuereth the very laſt petition and concluſion of the Lords praier. VII. VVe are taught in this petition to lift vp our heads, to thinke vpon, and to deſire an other bleſſed life to come which is eternall, where ſhall be full deliuerance from all euill. And becauſe we are too much occupied and plunged in the matters and affaires of this life and of this world; we doe alſo requeſt, that God would inſpire, excite, kindle, beget and preſerue in vs this meditation and deſire: that we couet to be diſſolued, that is, to leaue this life, and to paſſe to another bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life. And becauſe euery kinde of death
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:11241:66"/>is not the ende of miſerie, for the death of the wicked is the beginning of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Luk. 16.22. but the death of the godly is a deliuerance from all euill, and a beginning of euerlaſting happines: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we ſay, Deliuer vs from euill, we doe alſo deſire, that our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would keepe vs from euill death, that we may not die the death of the vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Ezek. 28.10. or the death of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which is worſt of all, Pſal. 34.22. that we may not die careleſſe in our ſinnes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared without repentance, Ioh. 8.24. But that he would graunt vnto vs a godly and ſauing ende of this life, that we may die in the Lord, Apoc. 14.13. that whether we liue or die we may be the lords, Rom. 14.8. whether we abide in the pilgrimage of this life, or be called home to our owne countrie by death, yet ſtill we may pleaſe the Lord, 2. Corin. 5.9. Furthermore we pray that God would put into vs a care &amp; deſire to prouide betime for our ſelues thoſe things which are neceſſarie to dying well, that we may be prepared for death,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:11241:66"/>leaſt we want oyle in our lamps when the bridegroome commeth and calleth for vs, Math. 25.3. And that in the laſt howre of this life we may haue true repentance, the word, the Sacraments, faith, hope, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace and of praier, that when we are to die we may be found in Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Philip. 3.9.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that righteouſnes which is of God through the faith of Chriſt, that ſo we may rightly commend our ſoule into the handes of our Father. And if we be not found ſufficiently prepared, we pray that he would not ſuffer vs to be preuented by ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death at vnawares, but would mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully graunt vs ſpace for ſuch preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that our death may be a deliuerance from all euill, and a paſſage out of this vale of miſeries to eternall life. So that in this petition we beſeech the Lord mercifully to be preſent with vs in that laſt and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conflict, wherein our aduerſarie goeth about moſt buſily, marking whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can ſnatch vs away and deuoure vs, that ſo we may be kept and deliuered from all euill. And that he would ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:11241:67"/>vs, that we may not feare to die, not be afraid of death, nor taſt thereof: but may depart in peace, and ſo when we die may be truly deliuered from all euill.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges we muſt pray for in this petition, both generally and in particular, crauing bleſsings of the Lord, praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt euils, giuing thanks for benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and confeſsing our owne ſinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For thine is the kingdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note>

But all Greeke copies haue it conſtantly: and the Syrian interpreter tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated it: Chryſoſtome alſo expoundeth it. Likewiſe Paul, 2. Tim. 4.17. rehearſing the laſt petition of Deliuerance from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, addeth this clauſe, to whome be glorie for euer and euer.

               </gap>ly conclude the whole praier. For it doth ſpecially put God in mind of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and as it were of his office, ſhewing the cauſe wherefore we aske thoſe things of God, and hope that he will giue them vnto vs.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:11241:67"/>
            <p>
               <hi>For thine is the kingdome.]</hi> Here he vnderſtandeth not Gods vniuerſall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ouer all creatures; but that which is called the kingdome of heauen, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and of Chriſt in the church. And theſe things which we aske are the bleſsings of this kingdome, which God hath therefore ordained for our neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, againſt the deuill, the world, and the fleſh, that forſomuch as we cannot haue from our ſelues thoſe things we aske in praier, neither can attaine vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by our ſelues, we might yet receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his own kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And it belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to the office of our king in this kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he ſhould keepe &amp; defend vs againſt the deuil, the world, and the fleſh; and that he ſhould beſtow thoſe bleſsings on them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and pray vnto him, as he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to aske, and wherein he hath promiſed to graunt our requeſts.</p>
            <p>This praier then in theſe words doth put God in minde of his commandement, of his promiſe, and of his office in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and withall ſheweth the cauſe, why
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:11241:68"/>a man asketh theſe things, and ſeeketh for them not to any other but to God alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thine is the power.]</hi> Theſe wordes teach vs, that god hath theſe things which we aske, in his hand and in his power, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the power of the world and of the deuill be great, and that he onely can giue theſe things vnto vs perfectly and for our good. Therefore doe we craue theſe things of him alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And glorie.]</hi> In this word, faith ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto God, that this is a glorious thing vnto him, and doth greatly turne to the glorie, and praiſe, and renowme of his mercie, power, and bountifulnes, if he ſhall heare vs, and ſhall graunt vnto vs thoſe things which we aske according to his commandement and promiſe, as citizens of his kingdome. So that in this clauſe we pray, that God for Chriſts ſake, whoſe kingdome properly this is, of his grace, whereby he gouerneth this kingdome, would heare vs and graunt our requeſts, for the ſetting forth of the bountie, of the power and glorie of this kingdome.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:11241:68"/>
            <p>Secondly, this clauſe alſo ſerueth to ſtirre vp and to confirme the faith of them that pray in aſſurance that they ſhall be heard. For ſeeing [thine is the kingdome] which is therefore ordained, becauſe in it he will beſtow ſuch benefits, he hath commanded vs to aske them in his kingdome, and hath promiſed to here vs: therfore in theſe wordes faith ſhewes it ſelfe certen of gods good will towards vs, and with all profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that in praier it relieth not on any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or worthineſſe of it owne, but on the fauour of God alone for Chriſts ſake: for it is the kingdome of Chriſt and of grace. Then to the will of God he addeth power for he ſaith: [<hi>Thine is the power.</hi> So that being aſſured, that god is both willing, &amp; able to performe thoſe things which we aske: faith therefore neither can nor ought to doubt of Gods hearing of vs. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſay: <hi>[Thine is the glorie:]</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith makes account, that god who is faithfull in performing the glory of his trueth, of his grace, and of his power, will ſurely accompliſh thoſe things which we
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:11241:69"/>aske, leſt the heathen ſay; where is novv their god.</p>
            <p>Thirdly this clauſe ſheweth vs, how we are to vſe thoſe benefites which we deſire in prayer, for what ende we are to aske them, and whither we are to referre them, and withall here we do promiſe, to what end we will referre them, and howe we will vſe them, or what thankefulneſſe we doe promiſe to God. To wit, as it is ſaide, Pſal, 145.10. <hi>They ſhall ſhewe the glorie of thy kingdome, and ſpeake of thy power: to cauſe thy power to be knowne to the ſonnes of men, and the glorious renowne of thy kingdome.</hi> Now what is that glorie of Gods kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, &amp; how it is to be renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that whole pſalme teacheth from the beginning to the ende.

But if thou haſt defiled it, &amp;c. god make thee accurſed, &amp;c.</hi> and the woman ſhal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>amen, amen.</hi> And Rabbi Dauid ſaith, this was ſpoken by way of prayer, or by way of aſſuming, whereby they tooke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues and vpon themſelues thoſe curſes if they had offended.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is vſed for the moſt part in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or inuocation, in bleſsing and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, 1. Cor. 14.16. when prayers &amp; thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuings are rehearſed, the Church anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>Amen.</hi> Pſal. 41.14. <hi>Amen, amen,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem. 8.6. Ezra bleſſed the Lord, and all the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:11241:70"/>people lifted vp their hands, and anſwered <hi>Amen, amen.</hi> Tobi. 9.12. they all ſay, <hi>Amen</hi> to the blesſing vpon the marriage. Apoc. 7.12. they worſhipped God, ſaying, <hi>Ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. praiſe, and glory, and wiſdome, and thanks, and honour, and power, and might be vnto our God for euermore, Amen.</hi> And ſo it is a note of wiſhing and deſiring: to witte, that faith in a true deſire of heart wiſheth, &amp; by true hope expecteth, that thoſe thinges which we aske in prayer may be done &amp; performed. Thus in the ſtory of Samoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus with Euſebius, and with Ambroſe in the 4. booke of the ſacraments, when as in the adminiſtration of the Lords ſupper, the bread of the Lord is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to euery one with theſe wordes: <hi>Take, eate, this is the body of Chriſt giuen for thee, for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes:</hi> Then euery communicant anſwered <hi>Amen.</hi> And 3. Kings, 1.36. there is a notable explication of this particle, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> For when Dauid had commaunded that Salomon ſhould be anointed king to ſucceed him, and had further commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to ſay, <hi>God ſaue king Salomon:</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:11241:70"/>Benias anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Amen: Let the Lord God of my Lord the king ſay ſo.</hi> Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſaith, it is the imparatiue paſsiue of the firſt coniugation for <hi>Heamen,</hi> that the meaning of it ſhould be this; let this be true, let this be ratified, and confirmed of the Lord. The Chaldie dictionarie ſaith, it is the future tenſe, hauing the firſt letter cut off, <hi>Ieamen:</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">This is warranted 2. Chr. 1.9. <hi>Ieamen deuere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let thy word be verified, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> let this be confirmed or ſtabliſhed. The Greekes regarding the roote haue moſt notably tranſlated that place, 3. King. 1.36. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>So be it, the Lord God ratifie and doe the word of my lord the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. This particle <hi>[Amen]</hi> is alſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when faith receiueth a promiſe propounded. So 1. Chron. 16.36. after the rehearſall of the promiſes of God, this is added: <hi>And let all the people ſay, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> Ier. 11. v. 5. The Lord repeateth this promiſe: <hi>I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people, that I may confirme mine oath, &amp;c.</hi> and I anſwered ſaith Ieremie, <hi>Amen, O Lord</hi> and Ierem. 28.6. when <hi>Hananie</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:11241:71"/>prophecied of proſperitie: Ieremie ſaith, <hi>Amen:</hi> and addeth a large expoſition of that word, Amen: <hi>The Lord ſo doe, the Lord confirme thy words, that it may be ſo as thou haſt prophecied</hi> Luke 1. Marie hath notably expreſſed the ſignification of this particle Amen: <hi>Be it vnto me according to thy word.</hi> And theſe ſignifications come all to one almoſt: which yet for plainer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications ſake, I thought good thus to diſtinguiſh, that the properties of faith in applying the promiſe, and in prayer, might the better be conſidered by the vſe of this particle, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Amen,</hi> is vſed for a note of <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> and <hi>aſſeveration:</hi> as 2. Cor. 1.20. <hi>The promiſes of God are not yea, and nay,</hi> (to witte, as though in them one thing might be ſaid in word, and an other thing thought in the heart: or els might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in words, and in deed be not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) <hi>but in Chriſt they are yea, &amp; Amen:</hi> where the Hebrew worde <hi>Amen,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Greek particle ναὶ, which is a note of affirming and aſſeuering. Iſa.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:11241:71"/>65.16. <hi>He that ſhall bleſſe himſelfe in the earth, ſhall bleſſe himſelfe in God Amen: and he that ſweareth ſhall ſweare in God Amen.</hi> Whereas the greeke word ναὶ, ſo the word <hi>Amen</hi> alſo is a note of ſwearing when any thing is affirmed and auouched, as though an oath were added thereto: &amp; this laſt ſignification agreeth to thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the goſpels where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I ſay vnto you.</hi> And becauſe the root <hi>Ama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> with thoſe wordes that are deriued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hath the ſignification of truth, certenty, ſtability, conſtancy, &amp;c. therfore if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the perſon ſpeaking, it beareth this ſenſe: I ſpeake not at randum, raſhly or lightly: but truely, certenly, earneſtly, and conſtantly: and that is, I ſay, I affirme and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch as though I added an oath; or if it be referred to that which is ſpoken, it hath this ſenſe: that which I ſay, is no wauering thought, or doubtfull opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but it is true, certen, ſure, and ſtable which I ſay: which is neither chaunged nor altered, but is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſo decreed in the will of God, and ſhall indeed be ſo accompliſhed. And
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11241:72"/>the doubling of the word <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> doth enforce the aſſeueration, and may wel be expreſſed in our ſuparlatiue degree, which the hebrewes want: <hi>It is moſt ſure and firme that I ſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore this particle <hi>amen,</hi> in the greeke tranſlation of the olde teſtament, is ſometime expreſſed by the verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>fiat,</hi> be it ſo, Deutron. 27.15. and 26. Pſal. 41.14.3. Kings, 1.36. Numb. 5.22. Sometime it is tranſlated by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, truely, Ier. 28.6. ſometime the hebrew worde is vſed ſtill, 1. Chron. 16.36. <hi>let the people ſay ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> ſo Ier, 11.5. Nehem. 8.6. Tob. 9.12. the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>amen,</hi> is vſed in the greeke tongue; &amp; ſo it is kept ſtill in the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, where ſometime the expoſition of it is ſet down. For that which is ſaid of the widow, Mar. 12.43. <hi>Amen, I ſay, &amp;c.</hi> in Luk. 21.3. is thus expounded: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>ſurely I ſay vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe whereas this praier is concluded with this particle <hi>Amen,</hi> it teacheth vs, that when we come to the ende of our praier, we muſt conſider, with what deuotion we haue prayed, that it be no colde mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:11241:72"/>ouer of words. Therefore after we haue laid open our neceſsities and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, at the ende our minde is excited and ſtirred vp, to conceiue an earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt from the very heart, whereby the heat of our deſire is kindled and inflamed, which with inward ſighes doth humbly and deuoutly wiſh and deſire that our praier may be ratified and confirmed with God, that our heauenly father for Chriſt our Mediatours ſake, would bow downe his eare, would heare and receiue our praier, and performe thoſe things which we deſire <hi>[Amen, Amen:]</hi> let that be done, let that be done, O Lord, which I haue asked. II. By this particle, faith doth ſhew it ſelfe not to doubt, or to be caried about with the waues of miſtruſt, whether God will heare vs and will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thoſe things which we aske: but to make ſure account, that as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to aske, and hath promiſed that he will heare, ſo he will faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and accompliſh our requeſts. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by this particle, faith doth ſtirre vp
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:11241:73"/>it ſelfe, it doth vphold, defend, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it ſelfe againſt doubtings. For it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the worde [Amen] from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Amen, amen, I ſay vnto you, what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ye ſhall aske the father in thy name, he will giue it you:</hi> and hereto he ioynes his owne <hi>Amen,</hi> as it were a ſeale, becauſe he makes full account that God is faithfull and true, Ioh. 3. And hence Ierome very finely calleth this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>[Amen]</hi> the ſeale of prayer.</p>
